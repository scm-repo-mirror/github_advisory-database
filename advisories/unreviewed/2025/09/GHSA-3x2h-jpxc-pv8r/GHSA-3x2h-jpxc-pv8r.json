  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPI: processor: perflib: Move problematic pr->performance check\n\nCommit d33bd88ac0eb (\"ACPI: processor: perflib: Fix initial _PPC limit\napplication\") added a pr->performance check that prevents the frequency\nQoS request from being added when the given processor has no performance\nobject.  Unfortunately, this causes a WARN() in freq_qos_remove_request()\nto trigger on an attempt to take the given CPU offline later because the\nfrequency QoS object has not been added for it due to the missing\nperformance object.\n\nAddress this by moving the pr->performance check before calling\nacpi_processor_get_platform_limit() so it only prevents a limit from\nbeing set for the CPU if the performance object is not present.  This\nway, the frequency QoS request is added as it was before the above\ncommit and it is present all the time along with the CPU's cpufreq\npolicy regardless of whether or not the CPU is online.",
