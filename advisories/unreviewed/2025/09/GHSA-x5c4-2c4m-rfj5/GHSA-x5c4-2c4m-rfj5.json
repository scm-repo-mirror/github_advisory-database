  "details": "Rapid7 AppSpider Pro versions below 7.5.021 suffer from a project name validation vulnerability, whereby an attacker can change the project name directly in the configuration file to a name that already exists. This issue stems from a lack of effective verification of the uniqueness of project names when editing them outside the application in affected versions. This vulnerability was remediated in version 7.5.021 of the product.",
