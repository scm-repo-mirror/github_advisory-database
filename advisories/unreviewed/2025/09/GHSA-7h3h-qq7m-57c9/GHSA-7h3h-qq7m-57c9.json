  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncacheinfo: Fix shared_cpu_map to handle shared caches at different levels\n\nThe cacheinfo sets up the shared_cpu_map by checking whether the caches\nwith the same index are shared between CPUs. However, this will trigger\nslab-out-of-bounds access if the CPUs do not have the same cache hierarchy.\nAnother problem is the mismatched shared_cpu_map when the shared cache does\nnot have the same index between CPUs.\n\nCPU0\tI\tD\tL3\nindex\t0\t1\t2\tx\n\t^\t^\t^\t^\nindex\t0\t1\t2\t3\nCPU1\tI\tD\tL2\tL3\n\nThis patch checks each cache is shared with all caches on other CPUs.",
