  "details": "A vulnerability ( CVE-2024-38229 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord ) exists in EOL ASP.NET when closing an HTTP/3 stream while application code is writing to the response body, a race condition may lead to use-after-free, resulting in Remote Code Execution.\n\n  Per  CWE-416: Use After Free https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html , Use After Free is when a product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory \"belongs\" to the code that operates on the new pointer.\n\n  This issue affects EOL ASP.NET 6.0.0 <= 6.0.36 as represented in this CVE, as well as 8.0.0 <= 8.0.8, 9.0.0-preview.1.24081.5 <= 9.0.0.RC.1 as represented in  CVE-2024-38229 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord .\n\n  Additionally, if you've deployed  self-contained applications https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd  targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n   NOTE: This CVE only represents End Of Life (EOL) software components. The vendor, Microsoft, has indicated there will be no future updates nor support provided upon inquiry.",
