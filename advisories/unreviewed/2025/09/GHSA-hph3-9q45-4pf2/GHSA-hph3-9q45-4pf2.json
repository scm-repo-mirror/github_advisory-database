  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/dp: Free resources after unregistering them\n\nThe DP component's unbind operation walks through the submodules to\nunregister and clean things up. But if the unbind happens because the DP\ncontroller itself is being removed, all the memory for those submodules\nhas just been freed.\n\nChange the order of these operations to avoid the many use-after-free\nthat otherwise happens in this code path.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/542166/",
