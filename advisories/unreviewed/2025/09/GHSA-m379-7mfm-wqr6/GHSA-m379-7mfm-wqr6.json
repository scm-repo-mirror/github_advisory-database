  "details": "The on-endpoint Microsoft vulnerable driver blocklist is not fully synchronized with the online Microsoft recommended driver block rules. Some entries present on the online list have been excluded from the on-endpoint blocklist longer than the expected periodic monthly Windows updates. It is possible to fully synchronize the driver blocklist using WDAC policies. NOTE: The vendor explains that Windows Update provides a smaller, compatibility-focused driver blocklist for general users, while the full XML list is available for advanced users and organizations to customize at the risk of usability issues.",
