  "details": "Accela Automation Platform 22.2.3.0.230103 contains multiple vulnerabilities in the Test Script feature. An authenticated administrative user can execute arbitrary Java code on the server, resulting in remote code execution. In addition, improper input validation allows for arbitrary file write and server-side request forgery (SSRF), enabling interaction with internal or external systems. Successful exploitation can lead to full server compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and further network exploitation.",
