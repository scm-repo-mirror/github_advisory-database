  "details": "The LB-Link BL-CPE300M AX300 4G LTE Router firmware version BL-R8800_B10_ALK_SL_V01.01.02P42U14_06 does not implement proper session handling. After a user authenticates from a specific IP address, the router grants access to any other client using that same IP, without requiring credentials or verifying client identity. There are no session tokens, cookies, or unique identifiers in place. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain full administrative access simply by configuring their device to use the same IP address as a previously authenticated user. This results in a complete authentication bypass.",
