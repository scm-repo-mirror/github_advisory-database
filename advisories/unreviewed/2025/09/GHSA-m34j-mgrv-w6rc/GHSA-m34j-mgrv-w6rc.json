  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: hda: fix a possible null-pointer dereference due to data race in snd_hdac_regmap_sync()\n\nThe variable codec->regmap is often protected by the lock\ncodec->regmap_lock when is accessed. However, it is accessed without\nholding the lock when is accessed in snd_hdac_regmap_sync():\n\n  if (codec->regmap)\n\nIn my opinion, this may be a harmful race, because if codec->regmap is\nset to NULL right after the condition is checked, a null-pointer\ndereference can occur in the called function regcache_sync():\n\n  map->lock(map->lock_arg); --> Line 360 in drivers/base/regmap/regcache.c\n\nTo fix this possible null-pointer dereference caused by data race, the\nmutex_lock coverage is extended to protect the if statement as well as the\nfunction call to regcache_sync().\n\n[ Note: the lack of the regmap_lock itself is harmless for the current\n  codec driver implementations, as snd_hdac_regmap_sync() is only for\n  PM runtime resume that is prohibited during the codec probe.\n  But the change makes the whole code more consistent, so it's merged\n  as is -- tiwai ]",
