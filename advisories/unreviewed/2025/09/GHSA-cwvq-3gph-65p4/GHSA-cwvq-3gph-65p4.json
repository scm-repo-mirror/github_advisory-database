  "details": "A mass assignment vulnerability exists in danny-avila/librechat, affecting all versions. This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate sensitive fields by automatically binding user-provided data to internal object properties or database fields without proper filtering. As a result, any extra fields in the request body are included in agentData and passed to the database layer, allowing overwriting of any field in the schema, such as author, access_level, isCollaborative, and projectIds. Additionally, the Object.Prototype can be polluted due to the use of Object.assign with spread operators.",
