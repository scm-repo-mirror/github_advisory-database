  "details": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 1.0.735 and Application prior to 20.0.1330 (Windows client deployments) contain a remote code execution vulnerability during driver installation caused by unquoted program paths. The PrinterInstallerClient driver-installation component launches programs using an unquoted path under \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Printer Properties Pro\\Printer Installer\". Because the path is unquoted, the operating system may execute a program located at a short-path location such as C:\\Program.exe before the intended binaries in the quoted path. If an attacker can place or cause a program to exist at that location, it will be executed with the privileges of the installer process (which may be elevated), enabling arbitrary code execution and potential privilege escalation. This weakness can be used to achieve remote code execution and full compromise of affected Windows endpoints.",
