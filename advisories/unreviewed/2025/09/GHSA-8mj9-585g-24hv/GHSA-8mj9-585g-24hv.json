  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: call op_release, even when op_func returns an error\n\nFor ops with \"trivial\" replies, nfsd4_encode_operation will shortcut\nmost of the encoding work and skip to just marshalling up the status.\nOne of the things it skips is calling op_release. This could cause a\nmemory leak in the layoutget codepath if there is an error at an\ninopportune time.\n\nHave the compound processing engine always call op_release, even when\nop_func sets an error in op->status. With this change, we also need\nnfsd4_block_get_device_info_scsi to set the gd_device pointer to NULL\non error to avoid a double free.",
