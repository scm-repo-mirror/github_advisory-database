  "details": "The ip (aka node-ip) package through 2.0.1 (in NPM) might allow SSRF because the IP address value 0 is improperly categorized as globally routable via isPublic. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2024-29415. NOTE: in current versions of several applications, connection attempts to the IP address 0 (interpreted as 0.0.0.0) are blocked with error messages such as net::ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID. However, in some situations that depend on both application version and operating system, connection attempts to 0 and 0.0.0.0 are considered connection attempts to 127.0.0.1 (and, for this reason, a false value of isPublic would be preferable).",
