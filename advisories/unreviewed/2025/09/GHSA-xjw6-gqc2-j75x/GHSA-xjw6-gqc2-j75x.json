  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlib/crypto: arm/poly1305: Fix register corruption in no-SIMD contexts\n\nRestore the SIMD usability check that was removed by commit 773426f4771b\n(\"crypto: arm/poly1305 - Add block-only interface\").\n\nThis safety check is cheap and is well worth eliminating a footgun.\nWhile the Poly1305 functions should not be called when SIMD registers\nare unusable, if they are anyway, they should just do the right thing\ninstead of corrupting random tasks' registers and/or computing incorrect\nMACs.  Fixing this is also needed for poly1305_kunit to pass.\n\nJust use may_use_simd() instead of the original crypto_simd_usable(),\nsince poly1305_kunit won't rely on crypto_simd_disabled_for_test.",
