  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstaging: pi433: fix memory leak with using debugfs_lookup()\n\nWhen calling debugfs_lookup() the result must have dput() called on it,\notherwise the memory will leak over time.  To make things simpler, just\ncall debugfs_lookup_and_remove() instead which handles all of the logic\nat once.  This requires saving off the root directory dentry to make\ncreation of individual device subdirectories easier.",
