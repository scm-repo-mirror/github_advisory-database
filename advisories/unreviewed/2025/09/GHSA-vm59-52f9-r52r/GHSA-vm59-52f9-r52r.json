  "details": "A privilege escalation flaw from host to domain administrator was found in FreeIPA. This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2025-4404, where it fails to validate the uniqueness of the krbCanonicalName. While the previously released version added validations for the admin@REALM credential, FreeIPA still does not validate the root@REALM canonical name, which can also be used as the realm administrator's name. This flaw allows an attacker to perform administrative tasks over the REALM, leading to access to sensitive data and sensitive data exfiltration.",
