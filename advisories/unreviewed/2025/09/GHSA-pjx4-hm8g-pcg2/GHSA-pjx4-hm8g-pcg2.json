  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/panfrost: Fix GEM handle creation ref-counting\n\npanfrost_gem_create_with_handle() previously returned a BO but with the\nonly reference being from the handle, which user space could in theory\nguess and release, causing a use-after-free. Additionally if the call to\npanfrost_gem_mapping_get() in panfrost_ioctl_create_bo() failed then\na(nother) reference on the BO was dropped.\n\nThe _create_with_handle() is a problematic pattern, so ditch it and\ninstead create the handle in panfrost_ioctl_create_bo(). If the call to\npanfrost_gem_mapping_get() fails then this means that user space has\nindeed gone behind our back and freed the handle. In which case just\nreturn an error code.",
