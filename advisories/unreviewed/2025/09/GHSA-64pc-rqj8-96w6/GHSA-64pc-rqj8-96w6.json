  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nefi: stmm: Fix incorrect buffer allocation method\n\nThe communication buffer allocated by setup_mm_hdr() is later on passed\nto tee_shm_register_kernel_buf(). The latter expects those buffers to be\ncontiguous pages, but setup_mm_hdr() just uses kmalloc(). That can cause\nvarious corruptions or BUGs, specifically since commit 9aec2fb0fd5e\n(\"slab: allocate frozen pages\"), though it was broken before as well.\n\nFix this by using alloc_pages_exact() instead of kmalloc().",
