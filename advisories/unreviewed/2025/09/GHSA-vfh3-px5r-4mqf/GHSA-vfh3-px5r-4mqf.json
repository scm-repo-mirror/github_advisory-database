  "details": "The 2wcom IP-4c 2.15.5 device's web interface includes an information disclosure vulnerability. By sending a crafted POST request to a specific endpoint (/cwi/ajax_request/get_data.php), an authenticated attacker (even with a low-privileged account like guest) can retrieve the hashed passwords for the admin, manager, and guest accounts. This significantly weakens the system's security posture, as these hashes could be cracked offline, granting attackers administrative access to the device.",
