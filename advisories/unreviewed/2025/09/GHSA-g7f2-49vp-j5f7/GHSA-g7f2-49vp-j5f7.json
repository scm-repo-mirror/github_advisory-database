  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPI: APEI: send SIGBUS to current task if synchronous memory error not recovered\n\nIf a synchronous error is detected as a result of user-space process\ntriggering a 2-bit uncorrected error, the CPU will take a synchronous\nerror exception such as Synchronous External Abort (SEA) on Arm64. The\nkernel will queue a memory_failure() work which poisons the related\npage, unmaps the page, and then sends a SIGBUS to the process, so that\na system wide panic can be avoided.\n\nHowever, no memory_failure() work will be queued when abnormal\nsynchronous errors occur. These errors can include situations like\ninvalid PA, unexpected severity, no memory failure config support,\ninvalid GUID section, etc. In such a case, the user-space process will\ntrigger SEA again.  This loop can potentially exceed the platform\nfirmware threshold or even trigger a kernel hard lockup, leading to a\nsystem reboot.\n\nFix it by performing a force kill if no memory_failure() work is queued\nfor synchronous errors.\n\n[ rjw: Changelog edits ]",
