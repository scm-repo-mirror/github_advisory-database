  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbnxt_en: Fix memory corruption when FW resources change during ifdown\n\nbnxt_set_dflt_rings() assumes that it is always called before any TC has\nbeen created.  So it doesn't take bp->num_tc into account and assumes\nthat it is always 0 or 1.\n\nIn the FW resource or capability change scenario, the FW will return\nflags in bnxt_hwrm_if_change() that will cause the driver to\nreinitialize and call bnxt_cancel_reservations().  This will lead to\nbnxt_init_dflt_ring_mode() calling bnxt_set_dflt_rings() and bp->num_tc\nmay be greater than 1.  This will cause bp->tx_ring[] to be sized too\nsmall and cause memory corruption in bnxt_alloc_cp_rings().\n\nFix it by properly scaling the TX rings by bp->num_tc in the code\npaths mentioned above.  Add 2 helper functions to determine\nbp->tx_nr_rings and bp->tx_nr_rings_per_tc.",
