  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Propagate error from htab_lock_bucket() to userspace\n\nIn __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch() if htab_lock_bucket() returns\n-EBUSY, it will go to next bucket. Going to next bucket may not only\nskip the elements in current bucket silently, but also incur\nout-of-bound memory access or expose kernel memory to userspace if\ncurrent bucket_cnt is greater than bucket_size or zero.\n\nFixing it by stopping batch operation and returning -EBUSY when\nhtab_lock_bucket() fails, and the application can retry or skip the busy\nbatch as needed.",
