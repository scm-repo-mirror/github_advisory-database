  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/s390: Fix memory corruption when using identity domain\n\nzpci_get_iommu_ctrs() returns counter information to be reported as part\nof device statistics; these counters are stored as part of the s390_domain.\nThe problem, however, is that the identity domain is not backed by an\ns390_domain and so the conversion via to_s390_domain() yields a bad address\nthat is zero'd initially and read on-demand later via a sysfs read.\nThese counters aren't necessary for the identity domain; just return NULL\nin this case.\n\nThis issue was discovered via KASAN with reports that look like:\nBUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in zpci_fmb_enable_device\nwhen using the identity domain for a device on s390.",
