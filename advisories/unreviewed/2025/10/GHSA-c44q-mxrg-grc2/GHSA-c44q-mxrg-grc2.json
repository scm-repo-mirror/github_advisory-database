  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpiolib: cdev: fix NULL-pointer dereferences\n\nThere are several places where we can crash the kernel by requesting\nlines, unbinding the GPIO device, then calling any of the system calls\nrelevant to the GPIO character device's annonymous file descriptors:\nioctl(), read(), poll().\n\nWhile I observed it with the GPIO simulator, it will also happen for any\nof the GPIO devices that can be hot-unplugged - for instance any HID GPIO\nexpander (e.g. CP2112).\n\nThis affects both v1 and v2 uAPI.\n\nThis fixes it partially by checking if gdev->chip is not NULL but it\ndoesn't entirely remedy the situation as we still have a race condition\nin which another thread can remove the device after the check.",
