  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/ntfs3: reject index allocation if $BITMAP is empty but blocks exist\n\nIndex allocation requires at least one bit in the $BITMAP attribute to\ntrack usage of index entries. If the bitmap is empty while index blocks\nare already present, this reflects on-disk corruption.\n\nsyzbot triggered this condition using a malformed NTFS image. During a\nrename() operation involving a long filename (which spans multiple\nindex entries), the empty bitmap allowed the name to be added without\nvalid tracking. Subsequent deletion of the original entry failed with\n-ENOENT, due to unexpected index state.\n\nReject such cases by verifying that the bitmap is not empty when index\nblocks exist.",
