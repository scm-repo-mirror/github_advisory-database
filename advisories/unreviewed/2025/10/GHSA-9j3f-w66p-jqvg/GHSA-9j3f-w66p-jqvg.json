  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: kexec: initialize kexec_buf struct in load_other_segments()\n\nPatch series \"kexec: Fix invalid field access\".\n\nThe kexec_buf structure was previously declared without initialization. \ncommit bf454ec31add (\"kexec_file: allow to place kexec_buf randomly\")\nadded a field that is always read but not consistently populated by all\narchitectures.  This un-initialized field will contain garbage.\n\nThis is also triggering a UBSAN warning when the uninitialized data was\naccessed:\n\n\t------------[ cut here ]------------\n\tUBSAN: invalid-load in ./include/linux/kexec.h:210:10\n\tload of value 252 is not a valid value for type '_Bool'\n\nZero-initializing kexec_buf at declaration ensures all fields are cleanly\nset, preventing future instances of uninitialized memory being used.\n\nAn initial fix was already landed for arm64[0], and this patchset fixes\nthe problem on the remaining arm64 code and on riscv, as raised by Mark.\n\nDiscussions about this problem could be found at[1][2].\n\n\nThis patch (of 3):\n\nThe kexec_buf structure was previously declared without initialization.\ncommit bf454ec31add (\"kexec_file: allow to place kexec_buf randomly\")\nadded a field that is always read but not consistently populated by all\narchitectures.
