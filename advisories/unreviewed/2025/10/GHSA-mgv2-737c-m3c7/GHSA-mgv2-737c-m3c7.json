  "details": "Bambu Studio 2.1.1.52 and earlier is affected by a vulnerability that allows arbitrary code execution during application startup. The application loads a network plugin without validating its digital signature or verifying its authenticity. A local attacker can exploit this behavior by placing a malicious component in the expected location, which is controllable by the attacker (e.g., under %APPDATA%), resulting in code execution within the context of the user. The main application is digitally signed, which may allow a malicious component to inherit trust and evade detection by security solutions that rely on signed parent processes.",
