  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915: mark requests for GuC virtual engines to avoid use-after-free\n\nReferences to i915_requests may be trapped by userspace inside a\nsync_file or dmabuf (dma-resv) and held indefinitely across different\nproceses. To counter-act the memory leaks, we try to not to keep\nreferences from the request past their completion.\nOn the other side on fence release we need to know if rq->engine\nis valid and points to hw engine (true for non-virtual requests).\nTo make it possible extra bit has been added to rq->execution_mask,\nfor marking virtual engines.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 280410677af763f3871b93e794a199cfcf6fb580)",
