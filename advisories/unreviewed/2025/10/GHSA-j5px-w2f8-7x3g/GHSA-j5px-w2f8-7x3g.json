  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvdpa: Add features attr to vdpa_nl_policy for nlattr length check\n\nThe vdpa_nl_policy structure is used to validate the nlattr when parsing\nthe incoming nlmsg. It will ensure the attribute being described produces\na valid nlattr pointer in info->attrs before entering into each handler\nin vdpa_nl_ops.\n\nThat is to say, the missing part in vdpa_nl_policy may lead to illegal\nnlattr after parsing, which could lead to OOB read just like CVE-2023-3773.\n\nThis patch adds the missing nla_policy for vdpa features attr to avoid\nsuch bugs.",
