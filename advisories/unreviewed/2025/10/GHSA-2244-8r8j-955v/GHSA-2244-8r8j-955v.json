  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: reject invalid reloc tree root keys with stack dump\n\n[BUG]\nSyzbot reported a crash that an ASSERT() got triggered inside\nprepare_to_merge().\n\nThat ASSERT() makes sure the reloc tree is properly pointed back by its\nsubvolume tree.\n\n[CAUSE]\nAfter more debugging output, it turns out we had an invalid reloc tree:\n\n  BTRFS error (device loop1): reloc tree mismatch, root 8 has no reloc root, expect reloc root key (-8, 132, 8) gen 17\n\nNote the above root key is (TREE_RELOC_OBJECTID, ROOT_ITEM,\nQUOTA_TREE_OBJECTID), meaning it's a reloc tree for quota tree.\n\nBut reloc trees can only exist for subvolumes, as for non-subvolume\ntrees, we just COW the involved tree block, no need to create a reloc\ntree since those tree blocks won't be shared with other trees.\n\nOnly subvolumes tree can share tree blocks with other trees (thus they\nhave BTRFS_ROOT_SHAREABLE flag).\n\nThus this new debug output proves my previous assumption that corrupted\non-disk data can trigger that ASSERT().\n\n[FIX]\nBesides the dedicated fix and the graceful exit, also let tree-checker to\ncheck such root keys, to make sure reloc trees can only exist for subvolumes.",
