  "details": "A hard-coded weak password vulnerability has been discovered in all Magic-branded devices from Chinese network equipment manufacturer H3C. The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded weak password for the root account in the /etc/shadow configuration or even the absence of any password at all. Some of these devices have the Telnet service enabled by default, or users can choose to enable the Telnet service in other device management interfaces (e.g. /debug.asp or /debug_telnet.asp). In addition, these devices have related interfaces called Virtual Servers, which can map the devices to the public network, posing the risk of remote attacks. Therefore, attackers can obtain the highest root privileges of the devices through the Telnet service using the weak password hardcoded in the firmware (or without a password), and remote attacks are possible.",
