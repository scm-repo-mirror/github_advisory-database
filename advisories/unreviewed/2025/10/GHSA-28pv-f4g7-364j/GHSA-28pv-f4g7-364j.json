  ],
  "details": "python-jose thru 3.3.0 allows JWT tokens with 'alg=none' to be decoded and accepted without any cryptographic signature verification. A malicious actor can craft a forged token with arbitrary claims (e.g., is_admin=true) and bypass authentication checks, leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized access in applications that rely on python-jose for token validation. This issue is exploitable unless developers explicitly reject 'alg=none' tokens, which is not enforced by the library.",
