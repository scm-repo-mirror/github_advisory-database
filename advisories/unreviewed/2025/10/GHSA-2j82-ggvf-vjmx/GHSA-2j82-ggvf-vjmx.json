  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nf2fs: fix dereference of stale list iterator after loop body\n\nThe list iterator variable will be a bogus pointer if no break was hit.\nDereferencing it (cur->page in this case) could load an out-of-bounds/undefined\nvalue making it unsafe to use that in the comparision to determine if the\nspecific element was found.\n\nSince 'cur->page' *can* be out-ouf-bounds it cannot be guaranteed that\nby chance (or intention of an attacker) it matches the value of 'page'\neven though the correct element was not found.\n\nThis is fixed by using a separate list iterator variable for the loop\nand only setting the original variable if a suitable element was found.\nThen determing if the element was found is simply checking if the\nvariable is set.",
