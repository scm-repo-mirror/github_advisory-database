  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: comp - Use same definition of context alloc and free ops\n\nIn commit 42d9f6c77479 (\"crypto: acomp - Move scomp stream allocation\ncode into acomp\"), the crypto_acomp_streams struct was made to rely on\nhaving the alloc_ctx and free_ctx operations defined in the same order\nas the scomp_alg struct. But in that same commit, the alloc_ctx and\nfree_ctx members of scomp_alg may be randomized by structure layout\nrandomization, since they are contained in a pure ops structure\n(containing only function pointers). If the pointers within scomp_alg\nare randomized, but those in crypto_acomp_streams are not, then\nthe order may no longer match. This fixes the problem by removing the\nunion from scomp_alg so that both crypto_acomp_streams and scomp_alg\nwill share the same definition of alloc_ctx and free_ctx, ensuring\nthey will always have the same layout.",
