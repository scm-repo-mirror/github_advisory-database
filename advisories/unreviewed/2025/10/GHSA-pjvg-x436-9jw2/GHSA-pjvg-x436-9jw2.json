  "details": "The WP Restaurant Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'align' parameter of the restaurant_summary shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
