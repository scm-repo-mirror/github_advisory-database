  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncxl/acpi: Fix a use-after-free in cxl_parse_cfmws()\n\nKASAN and KFENCE detected an user-after-free in the CXL driver. This\nhappens in the cxl_decoder_add() fail path. KASAN prints the following\nerror:\n\n   BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in cxl_parse_cfmws (drivers/cxl/acpi.c:299)\n\nThis happens in cxl_parse_cfmws(), where put_device() is called,\nreleasing cxld, which is accessed later.\n\nUse the local variables in the dev_err() instead of pointing to the\nreleased memory. Since the dev_err() is printing a resource, change the open\ncoded print format to use the %pr format specifier.",
