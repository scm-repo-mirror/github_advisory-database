  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/ksm: fix race with VMA iteration and mm_struct teardown\n\nexit_mmap() will tear down the VMAs and maple tree with the mmap_lock held\nin write mode.  Ensure that the maple tree is still valid by checking\nksm_test_exit() after taking the mmap_lock in read mode, but before the\nfor_each_vma() iterator dereferences a destroyed maple tree.\n\nSince the maple tree is destroyed, the flags telling lockdep to check an\nexternal lock has been cleared.  Skip the for_each_vma() iterator to avoid\ndereferencing a maple tree without the external lock flag, which would\ncreate a lockdep warning.",
