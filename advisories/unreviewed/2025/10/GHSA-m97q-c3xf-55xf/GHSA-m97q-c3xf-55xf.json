  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: fix fget leak when fs don't support nowait buffered read\n\nHeming reported a BUG when using io_uring doing link-cp on ocfs2. [1]\n\nDo the following steps can reproduce this BUG:\nmount -t ocfs2 /dev/vdc /mnt/ocfs2\ncp testfile /mnt/ocfs2/\n./link-cp /mnt/ocfs2/testfile /mnt/ocfs2/testfile.1\numount /mnt/ocfs2\n\nThen umount will fail, and it outputs:\numount: /mnt/ocfs2: target is busy.\n\nWhile tracing umount, it blames mnt_get_count() not return as expected.\nDo a deep investigation for fget()/fput() on related code flow, I've\nfinally found that fget() leaks since ocfs2 doesn't support nowait\nbuffered read.\n\nio_issue_sqe\n|-io_assign_file  // do fget() first\n  |-io_read\n  |-io_iter_do_read\n    |-ocfs2_file_read_iter  // return -EOPNOTSUPP\n  |-kiocb_done\n    |-io_rw_done\n      |-__io_complete_rw_common  // set REQ_F_REISSUE\n    |-io_resubmit_prep\n      |-io_req_prep_async  // override req->file, leak happens\n\nThis was introduced by commit a196c78b5443 in v5.18. Fix it by don't\nre-assign req->file if it has already been assigned.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/ocfs2-devel/ab580a75-91c8-d68a-3455-40361be1bfa8@linux.alibaba.com/T/#t",
