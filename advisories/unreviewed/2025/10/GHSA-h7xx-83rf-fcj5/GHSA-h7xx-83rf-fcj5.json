  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvirtio-mmio: don't break lifecycle of vm_dev\n\nvm_dev has a separate lifecycle because it has a 'struct device'\nembedded. Thus, having a release callback for it is correct.\n\nAllocating the vm_dev struct with devres totally breaks this protection,\nthough. Instead of waiting for the vm_dev release callback, the memory\nis freed when the platform_device is removed. Resulting in a\nuse-after-free when finally the callback is to be called.\n\nTo easily see the problem, compile the kernel with\nCONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE and unbind with sysfs.\n\nThe fix is easy, don't use devres in this case.\n\nFound during my research about object lifetime problems.",
