  "details": "The WP AD Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'startindex' parameter of the ad-gallery shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.3. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
