  "details": "alexusmai laravel-file-manager 3.3.1 and before allows an authenticated attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) through a crafted file upload. A file with a '.png` extension containing PHP code can be uploaded via the file manager interface. Although the upload appears to fail client-side validation, the file is still saved on the server. The attacker can then use the rename API to change the file extension to `.php`, and upon accessing it via a public URL, the server executes the embedded code.",
