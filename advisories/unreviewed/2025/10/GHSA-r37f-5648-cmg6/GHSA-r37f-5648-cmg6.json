  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915: Make intel_get_crtc_new_encoder() less oopsy\n\nThe point of the WARN was to print something, not oops\nstraight up. Currently that is precisely what happens\nif we can't find the connector for the crtc in the atomic\nstate. Get the dev pointer from the atomic state instead\nof the potentially NULL encoder to avoid that.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 3b6692357f70498f617ea1b31a0378070a0acf1c)",
