  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: sch_qfq: Fix null-deref in agg_dequeue\n\nTo prevent a potential crash in agg_dequeue (net/sched/sch_qfq.c)\nwhen cl->qdisc->ops->peek(cl->qdisc) returns NULL, we check the return\nvalue before using it, similar to the existing approach in sch_hfsc.c.\n\nTo avoid code duplication, the following changes are made:\n\n1. Changed qdisc_warn_nonwc(include/net/pkt_sched.h) into a static\ninline function.\n\n2. Moved qdisc_peek_len from net/sched/sch_hfsc.c to\ninclude/net/pkt_sched.h so that sch_qfq can reuse it.\n\n3. Applied qdisc_peek_len in agg_dequeue to avoid crashing.",
