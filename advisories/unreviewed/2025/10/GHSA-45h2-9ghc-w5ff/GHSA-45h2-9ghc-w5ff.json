  ],
  "details": "Ghost Robotics Vision 60 v0.27.2 includes, among its physical interfaces, three RJ45 connectors and a USB Type-C port. The vulnerability is due to the lack of authentication mechanisms when establishing connections through these ports. Specifically, with regard to network connectivity, the robot's internal router automatically assigns IP addresses to any device physically connected to it. An attacker could connect a WiFi access point under their control to gain access to the robot's network without needing the credentials for the deployed network. Once inside, the attacker can monitor all its data, as the robot runs on ROS 2 without authentication by default.",
