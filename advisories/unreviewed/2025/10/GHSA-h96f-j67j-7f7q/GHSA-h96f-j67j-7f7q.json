  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: nl80211: fix integer overflow in nl80211_parse_mbssid_elems()\n\nnl80211_parse_mbssid_elems() uses a u8 variable num_elems to count the\nnumber of MBSSID elements in the nested netlink attribute attrs, which can\nlead to an integer overflow if a user of the nl80211 interface specifies\n256 or more elements in the corresponding attribute in userspace. The\ninteger overflow can lead to a heap buffer overflow as num_elems determines\nthe size of the trailing array in elems, and this array is thereafter\nwritten to for each element in attrs.\n\nNote that this vulnerability only affects devices with the\nwiphy->mbssid_max_interfaces member set for the wireless physical device\nstruct in the device driver, and can only be triggered by a process with\nCAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities.\n\nFix this by checking for a maximum of 255 elements in attrs.",
