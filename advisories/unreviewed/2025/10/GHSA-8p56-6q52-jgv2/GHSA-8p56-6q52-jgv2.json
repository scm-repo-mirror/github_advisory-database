  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-mq: use quiesced elevator switch when reinitializing queues\n\nThe hctx's run_work may be racing with the elevator switch when\nreinitializing hardware queues. The queue is merely frozen in this\ncontext, but that only prevents requests from allocating and doesn't\nstop the hctx work from running. The work may get an elevator pointer\nthat's being torn down, and can result in use-after-free errors and\nkernel panics (example below). Use the quiesced elevator switch instead,\nand make the previous one static since it is now only used locally.\n\n  nvme nvme0: resetting controller\n  nvme nvme0: 32/0/0 default/read/poll queues\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008\n  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n  PGD 80000020c8861067 P4D 80000020c8861067 PUD 250f8c8067 PMD 0\n  Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI\n  Workqueue: kblockd blk_mq_run_work_fn\n  RIP: 0010:kyber_has_work+0x29/0x70\n\n...\n\n  Call Trace:\n   __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched+0x83/0x2b0\n   __blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x12e/0x170\n   blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x30/0x60\n   __blk_mq_run_hw_queue+0x2b/0x50\n   process_one_work+0x1ef/0x380\n   worker_thread+0x2d/0x3e0",
