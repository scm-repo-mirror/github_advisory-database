  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstart_kernel: Add __no_stack_protector function attribute\n\nBack during the discussion of\ncommit a9a3ed1eff36 (\"x86: Fix early boot crash on gcc-10, third try\")\nwe discussed the need for a function attribute to control the omission\nof stack protectors on a per-function basis; at the time Clang had\nsupport for no_stack_protector but GCC did not. This was fixed in\ngcc-11. Now that the function attribute is available, let's start using\nit.\n\nCallers of boot_init_stack_canary need to use this function attribute\nunless they're compiled with -fno-stack-protector, otherwise the canary\nstored in the stack slot of the caller will differ upon the call to\nboot_init_stack_canary. This will lead to a call to __stack_chk_fail()\nthen panic.",
