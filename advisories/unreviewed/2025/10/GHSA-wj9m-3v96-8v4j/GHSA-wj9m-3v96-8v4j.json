  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: ti: k3-udma: Reset UDMA_CHAN_RT byte counters to prevent overflow\n\nUDMA_CHAN_RT_*BCNT_REG stores the real-time channel bytecount statistics.\nThese registers are 32-bit hardware counters and the driver uses these\ncounters to monitor the operational progress status for a channel, when\ntransferring more than 4GB of data it was observed that these counters\noverflow and completion calculation of a operation gets affected and the\ntransfer hangs indefinitely.\n\nThis commit adds changes to decrease the byte count for every complete\ntransaction so that these registers never overflow and the proper byte\ncount statistics is maintained for ongoing transaction by the RT counters.\n\nEarlier uc->bcnt used to maintain a count of the completed bytes at driver\nside, since the RT counters maintain the statistics of current transaction\nnow, the maintenance of uc->bcnt is not necessary.",
