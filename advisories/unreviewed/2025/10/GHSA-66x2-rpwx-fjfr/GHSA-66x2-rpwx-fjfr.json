  ],
  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrivers: base: Free devm resources when unregistering a device\n\nIn the current code, devres_release_all() only gets called if the device\nhas a bus and has been probed.\n\nThis leads to issues when using bus-less or driver-less devices where\nthe device might never get freed if a managed resource holds a reference\nto the device. This is happening in the DRM framework for example.\n\nWe should thus call devres_release_all() in the device_del() function to\nmake sure that the device-managed actions are properly executed when the\ndevice is unregistered, even if it has neither a bus nor a driver.\n\nThis is effectively the same change than commit 2f8d16a996da (\"devres:\nrelease resources on device_del()\") that got reverted by commit\na525a3ddeaca (\"driver core: free devres in device_release\") over\nmemory leaks concerns.\n\nThis patch effectively combines the two commits mentioned above to\nrelease the resources both on device_del() and device_release() and get\nthe best of both worlds.",
