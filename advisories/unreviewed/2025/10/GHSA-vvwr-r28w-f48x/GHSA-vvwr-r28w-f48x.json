  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstaging: rtl8723bs: fix a potential memory leak in rtw_init_cmd_priv()\n\nIn rtw_init_cmd_priv(), if `pcmdpriv->rsp_allocated_buf` is allocated\nin failure, then `pcmdpriv->cmd_allocated_buf` will be not properly\nreleased. Besides, considering there are only two error paths and the\nfirst one can directly return, so we do not need implicitly jump to the\n`exit` tag to execute the error handler.\n\nSo this patch added `kfree(pcmdpriv->cmd_allocated_buf);` on the error\npath to release the resource and simplified the return logic of\nrtw_init_cmd_priv(). As there is no proper device to test with, no runtime\ntesting was performed.",
