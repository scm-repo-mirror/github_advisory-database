  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: transport_ipc: validate payload size before reading handle\n\nhandle_response() dereferences the payload as a 4-byte handle without\nverifying that the declared payload size is at least 4 bytes. A malformed\nor truncated message from ksmbd.mountd can lead to a 4-byte read past the\ndeclared payload size. Validate the size before dereferencing.\n\nThis is a minimal fix to guard the initial handle read.",
