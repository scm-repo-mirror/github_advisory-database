  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: j1939: implement NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification handler\n\nsyzbot is reporting\n\n  unregister_netdevice: waiting for vcan0 to become free. Usage count = 2\n\nproblem, for j1939 protocol did not have NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification\nhandler for undoing changes made by j1939_sk_bind().\n\nCommit 25fe97cb7620 (\"can: j1939: move j1939_priv_put() into sk_destruct\ncallback\") expects that a call to j1939_priv_put() can be unconditionally\ndelayed until j1939_sk_sock_destruct() is called. But we need to call\nj1939_priv_put() against an extra ref held by j1939_sk_bind() call\n(as a part of undoing changes made by j1939_sk_bind()) as soon as\nNETDEV_UNREGISTER notification fires (i.e. before j1939_sk_sock_destruct()\nis called via j1939_sk_release()). Otherwise, the extra ref on \"struct\nj1939_priv\" held by j1939_sk_bind() call prevents \"struct net_device\" from\ndropping the usage count to 1; making it impossible for\nunregister_netdevice() to continue.\n\n[mkl: remove space in front of label]",
