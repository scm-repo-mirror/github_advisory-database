  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxhci: Remove device endpoints from bandwidth list when freeing the device\n\nEndpoints are normally deleted from the bandwidth list when they are\ndropped, before the virt device is freed.\n\nIf xHC host is dying or being removed then the endpoints aren't dropped\ncleanly due to functions returning early to avoid interacting with a\nnon-accessible host controller.\n\nSo check and delete endpoints that are still on the bandwidth list when\nfreeing the virt device.\n\nSolves a list_del corruption kernel crash when unbinding xhci-pci,\ncaused by xhci_mem_cleanup() when it later tried to delete already freed\nendpoints from the bandwidth list.\n\nThis only affects hosts that use software bandwidth checking, which\ncurrenty is only the xHC in intel Panther Point PCH (Ivy Bridge)",
