  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: microchip: fix potential UAF in auxdev release callback\n\nSimilar to commit 1c11289b34ab (\"peci: cpu: Fix use-after-free in\nadev_release()\"), the auxiliary device is not torn down in the correct\norder. If auxiliary_device_add() fails, the release callback will be\ncalled twice, resulting in a UAF. Due to timing, the auxdev code in this\ndriver \"took inspiration\" from the aforementioned commit, and thus its\nbugs too!\n\nMoving auxiliary_device_uninit() to the unregister callback instead\navoids the issue.",
