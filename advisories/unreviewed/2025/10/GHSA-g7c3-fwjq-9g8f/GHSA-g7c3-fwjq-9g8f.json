  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncnic: Fix use-after-free bugs in cnic_delete_task\n\nThe original code uses cancel_delayed_work() in cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw(),\nwhich does not guarantee that the delayed work item 'delete_task' has\nfully completed if it was already running. Additionally, the delayed work\nitem is cyclic, the flush_workqueue() in cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw() only\nblocks and waits for work items that were already queued to the\nworkqueue prior to its invocation. Any work items submitted after\nflush_workqueue() is called are not included in the set of tasks that the\nflush operation awaits. This means that after the cyclic work items have\nfinished executing, a delayed work item may still exist in the workqueue.\nThis leads to use-after-free scenarios where the cnic_dev is deallocated\nby cnic_free_dev(), while delete_task remains active and attempt to\ndereference cnic_dev in cnic_delete_task().\n\nA typical race condition is illustrated below:\n\nCPU 0 (cleanup)              | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)\ncnic_netdev_event()          |\n  cnic_stop_hw()             | cnic_delete_task()\n    cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw()  | ...\n      cancel_delayed_work()  | /* the queue_delayed_work()\n      flush_workqueue()      |    executes after flush_workqueue()*/\n                             | queue_delayed_work()\n  cnic_free_dev(dev)//free   | cnic_delete_task() //new instance\n                             |   dev = cp->dev; //use\n\nReplace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure\nthat the cyclic delayed work item is properly canceled and that any\nongoing execution of the work item completes before the cnic_dev is\ndeallocated. Furthermore, since cancel_delayed_work_sync() uses\n__flush_work(work, true) to synchronously wait for any currently\nexecuting instance of the work item to finish, the flush_workqueue()\nbecomes redundant and should be removed.\n\nThis bug was identified through static analysis. To reproduce the issue\nand validate the fix, I simulated the cnic PCI device in QEMU and\nintroduced intentional delays — such as inserting calls to ssleep()\nwithin the cnic_delete_task() function — to increase the likelihood\nof triggering the bug.",
