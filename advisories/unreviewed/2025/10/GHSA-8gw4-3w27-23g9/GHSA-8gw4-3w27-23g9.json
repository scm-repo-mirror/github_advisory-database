  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpu: host1x: Fix memory leak of device names\n\nThe device names allocated by dev_set_name() need be freed\nbefore module unloading, but they can not be freed because\nthe kobject's refcount which was set in device_initialize()\nhas not be decreased to 0.\n\nAs comment of device_add() says, if it fails, use only\nput_device() drop the refcount, then the name will be\nfreed in kobejct_cleanup().\n\ndevice_del() and put_device() can be replaced with\ndevice_unregister(), so call it to unregister the added\nsuccessfully devices, and just call put_device() to the\nnot added device.\n\nAdd a release() function to device to avoid null release()\nfunction WARNING in device_release(), it's empty, because\nthe context devices are freed together in\nhost1x_memory_context_list_free().",
