  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpiolib: acpi: initialize acpi_gpio_info struct\n\nSince commit 7c010d463372 (\"gpiolib: acpi: Make sure we fill struct\nacpi_gpio_info\"), uninitialized acpi_gpio_info struct are passed to\n__acpi_find_gpio() and later in the call stack info->quirks is used in\nacpi_populate_gpio_lookup. This breaks the i2c_hid_cpi driver:\n\n[   58.122916] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-UNIW0001:00: HID over i2c has not been provided an Int IRQ\n[   58.123097] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-UNIW0001:00: probe with driver i2c_hid_acpi failed with error -22\n\nFix this by initializing the acpi_gpio_info pass to __acpi_find_gpio()",
