  "details": "The BrightTALK WordPress Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'format' shortcode attribute in the brighttalk-time shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.0. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
