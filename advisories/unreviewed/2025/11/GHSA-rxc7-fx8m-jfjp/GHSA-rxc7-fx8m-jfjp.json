  ],
  "details": "The WPFunnels – The Easiest Funnel Builder For WordPress And WooCommerce To Collect Leads And Increase Sales plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized user registration in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.2. This is due to the plugin relying on a user controlled value 'optin_allow_registration' to determine if user registration is allowed, instead of the site-specific setting. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register new user accounts, even when user registration is disabled.",
