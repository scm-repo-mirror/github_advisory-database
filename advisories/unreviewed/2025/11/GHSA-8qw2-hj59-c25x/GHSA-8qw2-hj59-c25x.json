  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix object lifecycle issue in update_qos_request()\n\nThe cpufreq_cpu_put() call in update_qos_request() takes place too early\nbecause the latter subsequently calls freq_qos_update_request() that\nindirectly accesses the policy object in question through the QoS request\nobject passed to it.\n\nFortunately, update_qos_request() is called under intel_pstate_driver_lock,\nso this issue does not matter for changing the intel_pstate operation\nmode, but it theoretically can cause a crash to occur on CPU device hot\nremoval (which currently can only happen in virt, but it is formally\nsupported nevertheless).\n\nAddress this issue by modifying update_qos_request() to drop the\nreference to the policy later.",
