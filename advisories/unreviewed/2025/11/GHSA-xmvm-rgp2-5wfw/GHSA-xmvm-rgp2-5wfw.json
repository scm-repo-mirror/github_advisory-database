  "details": "The send_message.php endpoint in SourceCodester Simple Public Chat Room 1.0 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application does not implement any CSRF-protection mechanisms such as tokens, nonces, or same-site cookie restrictions. An attacker can create a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated user, will automatically submit a forged POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. This request will be executed with the victim's privileges, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorized actions on their behalf, such as sending arbitrary messages in any chat room.",
