  ],
  "details": "A DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the text editor feature of the Onlook web application 0.2.32. This vulnerability occurs because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being directly injected into the DOM via innerHTML when editing a text element. An attacker can exploit this to inject malicious HTML and script code, which is then executed within the context of the preview iframe, allowing for the execution of arbitrary scripts in the user's session.",
