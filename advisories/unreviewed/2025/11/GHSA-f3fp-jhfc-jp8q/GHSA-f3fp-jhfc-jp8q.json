  "details": "Apache OpenOffice documents can contain links. A missing Authorization vulnerability in Apache OpenOffice allowed an attacker to craft a document that would cause external links \nto be loaded without prompt. In the affected versions of Apache OpenOffice, documents that used \"OLE objects\" linked to external files would \nload the contents of those files without prompting the user for \npermission to do so.\n\nThis issue affects Apache OpenOffice: through 4.1.15.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.16, which fixes the issue.",
