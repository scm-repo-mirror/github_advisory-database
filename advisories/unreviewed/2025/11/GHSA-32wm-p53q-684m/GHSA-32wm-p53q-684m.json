  "details": "An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the vehicleId parameter, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information of other users’ vehicles. Exploiting this issue enables an attacker to retrieve data such as GPS coordinates, encryption keys, initialization vectors, model numbers, and fuel statistics belonging to other users, instead of being limited to their own vehicle data. This is a server-side authorization fix.",
