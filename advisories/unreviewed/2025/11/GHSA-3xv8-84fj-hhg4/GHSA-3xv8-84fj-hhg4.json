  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPI: video: Fix use-after-free in acpi_video_switch_brightness()\n\nThe switch_brightness_work delayed work accesses device->brightness\nand device->backlight, freed by acpi_video_dev_unregister_backlight()\nduring device removal.\n\nIf the work executes after acpi_video_bus_unregister_backlight()\nfrees these resources, it causes a use-after-free when\nacpi_video_switch_brightness() dereferences device->brightness or\ndevice->backlight.\n\nFix this by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync() for each device's\nswitch_brightness_work in acpi_video_bus_remove_notify_handler()\nafter removing the notify handler that queues the work. This ensures\nthe work completes before the memory is freed.\n\n[ rjw: Changelog edit ]",
