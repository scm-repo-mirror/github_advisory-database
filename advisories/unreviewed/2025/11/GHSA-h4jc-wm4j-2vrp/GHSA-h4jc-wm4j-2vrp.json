  "details": "A command injection vulnerability exists in the MCP Data Science Server's (reading-plus-ai/mcp-server-data-exploration) 0.1.6 in the safe_eval() function (src/mcp_server_ds/server.py:108). The function uses Python's exec() to execute user-supplied scripts but fails to restrict the __builtins__ dictionary in the globals parameter. When __builtins__ is not explicitly defined, Python automatically provides access to all built-in functions including __import__, exec, eval, and open. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code with full system privileges, leading to complete system compromise. The vulnerability can be exploited by submitting a malicious script to the run_script tool, requiring no authentication or special privileges.",
