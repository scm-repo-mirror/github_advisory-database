  "details": "A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the management console of multiple WSO2 products due to improper output encoding. By tampering with specific parameters, a malicious actor can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the response, leading to reflected XSS.\n\nSuccessful exploitation could result in UI manipulation, redirection to malicious websites, or data theft from the browser. However, session-related sensitive cookies are protected with the httpOnly flag, which mitigates the risk of session hijacking.",
