  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information from an affected device.\n\n This vulnerability exists because certain files lack proper data protection mechanisms. An attacker with read-only Administrator privileges could exploit this vulnerability by performing actions where the results should only be viewable to a high-privileged user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view passwords that are normally not visible to read-only administrators.",
