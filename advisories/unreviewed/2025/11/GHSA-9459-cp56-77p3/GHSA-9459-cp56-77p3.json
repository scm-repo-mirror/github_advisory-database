  "details": "A command injection vulnerability exists in the D-Link DIR-823G router firmware DIR823G_V1.0.2B05_20181207.bin in the timelycheck and sysconf binaries, which process the /tmp/new_qos.rule configuration file.

An attacker with write access to /tmp/new_qos.rule can execute arbitrary commands on the device.",
