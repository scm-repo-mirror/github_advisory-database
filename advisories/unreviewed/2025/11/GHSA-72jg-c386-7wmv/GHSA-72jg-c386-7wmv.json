  ],
  "details": "The WP AUDIO GALLERY plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to the `wpag_uploadaudio_callback()` AJAX handler not properly validating user-supplied file paths in the `audio_upload` parameter before passing them to `unlink()`. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when critical files like wp-config.php are deleted.",
