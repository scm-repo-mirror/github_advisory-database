  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Fix memory leak in lpfc_create_port()\n\nCommit 5e633302ace1 (\"scsi: lpfc: vmid: Add support for VMID in mailbox\ncommand\") introduced allocations for the VMID resources in\nlpfc_create_port() after the call to scsi_host_alloc(). Upon failure on the\nVMID allocations, the new code would branch to the 'out' label, which\nreturns NULL without unwinding anything, thus skipping the call to\nscsi_host_put().\n\nFix the problem by creating a separate label 'out_free_vmid' to unwind the\nVMID resources and make the 'out_put_shost' label call only\nscsi_host_put(), as was done before the introduction of allocations for\nVMID.",
