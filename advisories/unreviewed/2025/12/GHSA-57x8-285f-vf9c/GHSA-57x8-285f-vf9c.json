  ],
  "details": "A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the omec-upf (upf-epc-pfcpiface) in version upf-epc-pfcpiface:2.1.3-dev. When the UPF receives a PFCP Association Setup Request that is missing the mandatory Recovery Time Stamp Information Element, the association setup handler dereferences a nil pointer via IE.RecoveryTimeStamp() instead of validating the message. This results in a panic and terminates the UPF process. An attacker who can send PFCP Association Setup Request messages to the UPF's N4/PFCP endpoint can exploit this issue to repeatedly crash the UPF and disrupt user-plane services.",
