  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmaple_tree: fix potential out-of-bounds access in mas_wr_end_piv()\n\nCheck the write offset end bounds before using it as the offset into the\npivot array.  This avoids a possible out-of-bounds access on the pivot\narray if the write extends to the last slot in the node, in which case the\nnode maximum should be used as the end pivot.\n\nakpm: this doesn't affect any current callers, but new users of mapletree\nmay encounter this problem if backported into earlier kernels, so let's\nfix it in -stable kernels in case of this.",
