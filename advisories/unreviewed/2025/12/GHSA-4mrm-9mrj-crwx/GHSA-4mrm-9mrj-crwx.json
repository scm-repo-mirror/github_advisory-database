  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-cgroup: dropping parent refcount after pd_free_fn() is done\n\nSome cgroup policies will access parent pd through child pd even\nafter pd_offline_fn() is done. If pd_free_fn() for parent is called\nbefore child, then UAF can be triggered. Hence it's better to guarantee\nthe order of pd_free_fn().\n\nCurrently refcount of parent blkg is dropped in __blkg_release(), which\nis before pd_free_fn() is called in blkg_free_work_fn() while\nblkg_free_work_fn() is called asynchronously.\n\nThis patch make sure pd_free_fn() called from removing cgroup is ordered\nby delaying dropping parent refcount after calling pd_free_fn() for\nchild.\n\nBTW, pd_free_fn() will also be called from blkcg_deactivate_policy()\nfrom deleting device, and following patches will guarantee the order.",
