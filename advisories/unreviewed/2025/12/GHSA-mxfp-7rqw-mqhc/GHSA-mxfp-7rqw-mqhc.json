  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: fix blktrace debugfs entries leakage\n\nCommit 99d055b4fd4b (\"block: remove per-disk debugfs files in\nblk_unregister_queue\") moves blk_trace_shutdown() from\nblk_release_queue() to blk_unregister_queue(), this is safe if blktrace\nis created through sysfs, however, there is a regression in corner\ncase.\n\nblktrace can still be enabled after del_gendisk() through ioctl if\nthe disk is opened before del_gendisk(), and if blktrace is not shutdown\nthrough ioctl before closing the disk, debugfs entries will be leaked.\n\nFix this problem by shutdown blktrace in disk_release(), this is safe\nbecause blk_trace_remove() is reentrant.",
