  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: uclogic: Correct devm device reference for hidinput input_dev name\n\nReference the HID device rather than the input device for the devm\nallocation of the input_dev name. Referencing the input_dev would lead to a\nuse-after-free when the input_dev was unregistered and subsequently fires a\nuevent that depends on the name. At the point of firing the uevent, the\nname would be freed by devres management.\n\nUse devm_kasprintf to simplify the logic for allocating memory and\nformatting the input_dev name string.",
