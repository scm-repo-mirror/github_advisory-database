  "details": "An unauthenticated device registration vulnerability, caused by Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes, has been identified in the MXsecurity Series. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted JSON payload to the device's registration endpoint /api/v1/devices/register, allowing the attacker to register unauthorized devices without authentication. Although exploiting this vulnerability has limited modification of data, there is no impact to the confidentiality and availability of the affected device, as well as no loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability within any subsequent systems.",
