  "details": "The myCred – Points Management System For Gamification, Ranks, Badges, and Loyalty Program plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in versions up to, and including, 2.9.7.1. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve sensitive information including user IDs, display names, and email addresses of all users on the site via the get_bank_accounts AJAX action. Passwords are not exposed.",
