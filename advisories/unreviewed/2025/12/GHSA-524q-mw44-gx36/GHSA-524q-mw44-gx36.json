  "details": "Due to a lack of certificate validation, all traffic from the mobile application can be intercepted. As a result, an adversary located \"upstream\" can decrypt the TLS traffic, inspect its contents, and modify the requests in transit. This may result in a total compromise of the user's account if the attacker intercepts a request with active authentication tokens or cracks the MD5 hash sent on login.",
