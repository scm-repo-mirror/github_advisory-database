  "details": "Apache Commons Text versions prior to 1.10.0 included interpolation features that could be abused when applications passed untrusted input into the text-substitution API. Because some interpolators could trigger actions like executing commands or accessing external resources, an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution. This vulnerability has been fully addressed in FileMaker Server 22.0.4.",
