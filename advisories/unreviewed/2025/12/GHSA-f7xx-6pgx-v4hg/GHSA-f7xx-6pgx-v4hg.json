  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: tls: avoid hanging tasks on the tx_lock\n\nsyzbot sent a hung task report and Eric explains that adversarial\nreceiver may keep RWIN at 0 for a long time, so we are not guaranteed\nto make forward progress. Thread which took tx_lock and went to sleep\nmay not release tx_lock for hours. Use interruptible sleep where\npossible and reschedule the work if it can't take the lock.\n\nTesting: existing selftest passes",
