  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommufd: Do not add the same hwpt to the ioas->hwpt_list twice\n\nThe hwpt is added to the hwpt_list only during its creation, it is never\nadded again. This hunk is some missed leftover from rework. Adding it\ntwice will corrupt the linked list in some cases.\n\nIt effects HWPT specific attachment, which is something the test suite\ncannot cover until we can create a legitimate struct device with a\nnon-system iommu \"driver\" (ie we need the bus removed from the iommu code)",
