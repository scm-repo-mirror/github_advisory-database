  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd/raid10: fix null-ptr-deref in raid10_sync_request\n\ninit_resync() inits mempool and sets conf->have_replacemnt at the beginning\nof sync, close_sync() frees the mempool when sync is completed.\n\nAfter [1] recovery might be skipped and init_resync() is called but\nclose_sync() is not. null-ptr-deref occurs with r10bio->dev[i].repl_bio.\n\nThe following is one way to reproduce the issue.\n\n  1) create a array, wait for resync to complete, mddev->recovery_cp is set\n     to MaxSector.\n  2) recovery is woken and it is skipped. conf->have_replacement is set to\n     0 in init_resync(). close_sync() not called.\n  3) some io errors and rdev A is set to WantReplacement.\n  4) a new device is added and set to A's replacement.\n  5) recovery is woken, A have replacement, but conf->have_replacemnt is\n     0. r10bio->dev[i].repl_bio will not be alloced and null-ptr-deref\n     occurs.\n\nFix it by not calling init_resync() if recovery skipped.\n\n[1] commit 7e83ccbecd60 (\"md/raid10: Allow skipping recovery when clean arrays are assembled\")",
