  "details": "Improper neutralization of the title date in the 'VDatePicker' component in Vuetify, allows unsanitized HTML to be inserted into the page. This can lead to a  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss  attack. The vulnerability occurs because the 'title-date-format' property of the 'VDatePicker' can accept a user created function and assign its output to the 'innerHTML' property of the title element without sanitization.\n\nThis issue affects Vuetify versions greater than or equal to 2.0.0 and less than 3.0.0.\n\nNote:\nVersion 2.x of Vuetify is End-of-Life and will not receive any updates to address this issue.
