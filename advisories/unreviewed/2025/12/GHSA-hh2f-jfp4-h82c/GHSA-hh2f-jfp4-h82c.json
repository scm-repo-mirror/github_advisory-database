  "details": "The Sermon Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the `sermon-views` shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.30.0. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
