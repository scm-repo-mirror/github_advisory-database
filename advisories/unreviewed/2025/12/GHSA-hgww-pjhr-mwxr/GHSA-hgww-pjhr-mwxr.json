  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: hidraw: fix data race on device refcount\n\nThe hidraw_open() function increments the hidraw device reference\ncounter. The counter has no dedicated synchronization mechanism,\nresulting in a potential data race when concurrently opening a device.\n\nThe race is a regression introduced by commit 8590222e4b02 (\"HID:\nhidraw: Replace hidraw device table mutex with a rwsem\"). While\nminors_rwsem is intended to protect the hidraw_table itself, by instead\nacquiring the lock for writing, the reference counter is also protected.\nThis is symmetrical to hidraw_release().",
