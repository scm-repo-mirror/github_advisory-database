  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: remove BUG_ON()'s in add_new_free_space()\n\nAt add_new_free_space() we have these BUG_ON()'s that are there to deal\nwith any failure to add free space to the in memory free space cache.\nSuch failures are mostly -ENOMEM that should be very rare. However there's\nno need to have these BUG_ON()'s, we can just return any error to the\ncaller and all callers and their upper call chain are already dealing with\nerrors.\n\nSo just make add_new_free_space() return any errors, while removing the\nBUG_ON()'s, and returning the total amount of added free space to an\noptional u64 pointer argument.",
