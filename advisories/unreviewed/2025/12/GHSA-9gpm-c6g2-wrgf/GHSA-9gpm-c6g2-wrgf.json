  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: ufs: core: Fix invalid probe error return value\n\nAfter DME Link Startup, the error return value is set to the MIPI UniPro\nGenericErrorCode which can be 0 (SUCCESS) or 1 (FAILURE).  Upon failure\nduring driver probe, the error code 1 is propagated back to the driver\nprobe function which must return a negative value to indicate an error,\nbut 1 is not negative, so the probe is considered to be successful even\nthough it failed.  Subsequently, removing the driver results in an oops\nbecause it is not in a valid state.\n\nThis happens because none of the callers of ufshcd_init() expect a\nnon-negative error code.\n\nFix the return value and documentation to match actual usage.",
