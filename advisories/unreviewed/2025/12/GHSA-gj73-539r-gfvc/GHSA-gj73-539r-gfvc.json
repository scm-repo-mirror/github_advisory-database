  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"drm/msm: Add missing check and destroy for alloc_ordered_workqueue\"\n\nThis reverts commit 643b7d0869cc7f1f7a5ac7ca6bd25d88f54e31d0.\n\nA recent patch that tried to fix up the msm_drm_init() paths with\nrespect to the workqueue but only ended up making things worse:\n\nFirst, the newly added calls to msm_drm_uninit() on early errors would\ntrigger NULL-pointer dereferences, for example, as the kms pointer would\nnot have been initialised. (Note that these paths were also modified by\na second broken error handling patch which in effect cancelled out this\npart when merged.)\n\nSecond, the newly added allocation sanity check would still leak the\npreviously allocated drm device.\n\nInstead of trying to salvage what was badly broken (and clearly not\ntested), let's revert the bad commit so that clean and backportable\nfixes can be added in its place.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/525107/",
