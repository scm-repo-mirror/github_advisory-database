  "details": "The Animated Pixel Marquee Creator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery via the 'marquee' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the marquee deletion function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary marquees via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
