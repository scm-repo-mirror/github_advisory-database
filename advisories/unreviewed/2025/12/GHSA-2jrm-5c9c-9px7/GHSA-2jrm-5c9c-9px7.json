  ],
  "details": "To enhance security, the FileMaker Server 22.0.4 installer now includes an option to disable IIS short filename enumeration by setting NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation in the Windows registry. This prevents attackers from using the tilde character to discover hidden files and directories. This vulnerability has been fully addressed in FileMaker Server 22.0.4. The IIS Shortname Vulnerability exploits how Microsoft IIS handles legacy 8.3 short filenames, allowing attackers to infer the existence of files or directories by crafting requests with the tilde (~) character.",
