  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: kvaser_usb: leaf: Fix potential infinite loop in command parsers\n\nThe `kvaser_usb_leaf_wait_cmd()` and `kvaser_usb_leaf_read_bulk_callback`\nfunctions contain logic to zero-length commands. These commands are used\nto align data to the USB endpoint's wMaxPacketSize boundary.\n\nThe driver attempts to skip these placeholders by aligning the buffer\nposition `pos` to the next packet boundary using `round_up()` function.\n\nHowever, if zero-length command is found exactly on a packet boundary\n(i.e., `pos` is a multiple of wMaxPacketSize, including 0), `round_up`\nfunction will return the unchanged value of `pos`. This prevents `pos`\nto be increased, causing an infinite loop in the parsing logic.\n\nThis patch fixes this in the function by using `pos + 1` instead.\nThis ensures that even if `pos` is on a boundary, the calculation is\nbased on `pos + 1`, forcing `round_up()` to always return the next\naligned boundary.",
