  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/damon/core: fix potential memory leak by cleaning ops_filter in damon_destroy_scheme\n\nCurrently, damon_destroy_scheme() only cleans up the filter list but\nleaves ops_filter untouched, which could lead to memory leaks when a\nscheme is destroyed.\n\nThis patch ensures both filter and ops_filter are properly freed in\ndamon_destroy_scheme(), preventing potential memory leaks.",
