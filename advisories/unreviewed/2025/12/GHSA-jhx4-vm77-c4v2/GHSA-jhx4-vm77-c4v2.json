  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: rsi: Do not configure WoWlan in shutdown hook if not enabled\n\nIn case WoWlan was never configured during the operation of the system,\nthe hw->wiphy->wowlan_config will be NULL. rsi_config_wowlan() checks\nwhether wowlan_config is non-NULL and if it is not, then WARNs about it.\nThe warning is valid, as during normal operation the rsi_config_wowlan()\nshould only ever be called with non-NULL wowlan_config. In shutdown this\nrsi_config_wowlan() should only ever be called if WoWlan was configured\nbefore by the user.\n\nAdd checks for non-NULL wowlan_config into the shutdown hook. While at it,\ncheck whether the wiphy is also non-NULL before accessing wowlan_config .\nDrop the single-use wowlan_config variable, just inline it into function\ncall.",
