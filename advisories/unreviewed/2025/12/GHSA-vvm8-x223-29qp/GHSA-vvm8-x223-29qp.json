  ],
  "details": "The Backup, Restore and Migrate your sites with XCloner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the Xcloner_Remote_Storage:save() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add or modify an FTP backup configuration via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to set an attacker-controlled FTP site for backup storage and exfiltrate potentially sensitive site data.",
