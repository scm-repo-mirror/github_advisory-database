  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nftrace: Fix softlockup in ftrace_module_enable\n\nA soft lockup was observed when loading amdgpu module.\nIf a module has a lot of tracable functions, multiple calls\nto kallsyms_lookup can spend too much time in RCU critical\nsection and with disabled preemption, causing kernel panic.\nThis is the same issue that was fixed in\ncommit d0b24b4e91fc (\"ftrace: Prevent RCU stall on PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY\nkernels\") and commit 42ea22e754ba (\"ftrace: Add cond_resched() to\nftrace_graph_set_hash()\").\n\nFix it the same way by adding cond_resched() in ftrace_module_enable.",
