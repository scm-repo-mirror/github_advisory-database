  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: drop unnecessary user-triggerable WARN_ONCE in verifierl log\n\nIt's trivial for user to trigger \"verifier log line truncated\" warning,\nas verifier has a fixed-sized buffer of 1024 bytes (as of now), and there are at\nleast two pieces of user-provided information that can be output through\nthis buffer, and both can be arbitrarily sized by user:\n  - BTF names;\n  - BTF.ext source code lines strings.\n\nVerifier log buffer should be properly sized for typical verifier state\noutput. But it's sort-of expected that this buffer won't be long enough\nin some circumstances. So let's drop the check. In any case code will\nwork correctly, at worst truncating a part of a single line output.",
