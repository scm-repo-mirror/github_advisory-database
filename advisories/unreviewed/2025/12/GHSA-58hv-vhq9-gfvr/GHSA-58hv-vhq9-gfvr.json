  "details": "SpaceX Starlink Dish devices with firmware 2024.12.04.mr46620 (e.g., on Mini1_prod2) allow administrative actions via unauthenticated LAN gRPC requests, aka MARMALADE 2. The cross-origin policy can be bypassed by omitting a Referer header. In some cases, an attacker's ability to read tilt, rotation, and elevation data via gRPC can make it easier to infer the geographical location of the dish.",
