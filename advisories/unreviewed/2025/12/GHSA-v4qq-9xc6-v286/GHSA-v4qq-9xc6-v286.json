  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\norangefs: fix xattr related buffer overflow...\n\nWilly Tarreau <w@1wt.eu> forwarded me a message from\nDisclosure <disclosure@aisle.com> with the following\nwarning:\n\n> The helper `xattr_key()` uses the pointer variable in the loop condition\n> rather than dereferencing it. As `key` is incremented, it remains non-NULL\n> (until it runs into unmapped memory), so the loop does not terminate on\n> valid C strings and will walk memory indefinitely, consuming CPU or hanging\n> the thread.\n\nI easily reproduced this with setfattr and getfattr, causing a kernel\noops, hung user processes and corrupted orangefs files. Disclosure\nsent along a diff (not a patch) with a suggested fix, which I based\nthis patch on.\n\nAfter xattr_key started working right, xfstest generic/069 exposed an\nxattr related memory leak that lead to OOM. xattr_key returns\na hashed key.  When adding xattrs to the orangefs xattr cache, orangefs\nused hash_add, a kernel hashing macro. hash_add also hashes the key using\nhash_log which resulted in additions to the xattr cache going to the wrong\nhash bucket. generic/069 tortures a single file and orangefs does a\ngetattr for the xattr \"security.capability\" every time. Orangefs\nnegative caches on xattrs which includes a kmalloc. Since adds to the\nxattr cache were going to the wrong bucket, every getattr for\n\"security.capability\" resulted in another kmalloc, none of which were\never freed.\n\nI changed the two uses of hash_add to hlist_add_head instead\nand the memory leak ceased and generic/069 quit throwing furniture.",
