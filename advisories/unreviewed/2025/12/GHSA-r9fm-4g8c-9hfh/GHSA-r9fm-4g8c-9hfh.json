  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: enetc: fix the deadlock of enetc_mdio_lock\n\nAfter applying the workaround for err050089, the LS1028A platform\nexperiences RCU stalls on RT kernel. This issue is caused by the\nrecursive acquisition of the read lock enetc_mdio_lock. Here list some\nof the call stacks identified under the enetc_poll path that may lead to\na deadlock:\n\nenetc_poll\n  -> enetc_lock_mdio\n  -> enetc_clean_rx_ring OR napi_complete_done\n     -> napi_gro_receive\n        -> enetc_start_xmit\n           -> enetc_lock_mdio\n           -> enetc_map_tx_buffs\n           -> enetc_unlock_mdio\n  -> enetc_unlock_mdio\n\nAfter enetc_poll acquires the read lock, a higher-priority writer attempts\nto acquire the lock, causing preemption. The writer detects that a\nread lock is already held and is scheduled out. However, readers under\nenetc_poll cannot acquire the read lock again because a writer is already\nwaiting, leading to a thread hang.\n\nCurrently, the deadlock is avoided by adjusting enetc_lock_mdio to prevent\nrecursive lock acquisition.",
