  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwrng: virtio - Fix race on data_avail and actual data\n\nThe virtio rng device kicks off a new entropy request whenever the\ndata available reaches zero.  When a new request occurs at the end\nof a read operation, that is, when the result of that request is\nonly needed by the next reader, then there is a race between the\nwriting of the new data and the next reader.\n\nThis is because there is no synchronisation whatsoever between the\nwriter and the reader.\n\nFix this by writing data_avail with smp_store_release and reading\nit with smp_load_acquire when we first enter read.  The subsequent\nreads are safe because they're either protected by the first load\nacquire, or by the completion mechanism.\n\nAlso remove the redundant zeroing of data_idx in random_recv_done\n(data_idx must already be zero at this point) and data_avail in\nrequest_entropy (ditto).",
