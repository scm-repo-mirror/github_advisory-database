  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: wacom: Use ktime_t rather than int when dealing with timestamps\n\nCode which interacts with timestamps needs to use the ktime_t type\nreturned by functions like ktime_get. The int type does not offer\nenough space to store these values, and attempting to use it is a\nrecipe for problems. In this particular case, overflows would occur\nwhen calculating/storing timestamps leading to incorrect values being\nreported to userspace. In some cases these bad timestamps cause input\nhandling in userspace to appear hung.",
