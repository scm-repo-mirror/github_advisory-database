  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: gs_usb: gs_usb_xmit_callback(): fix handling of failed transmitted URBs\n\nThe driver lacks the cleanup of failed transfers of URBs. This reduces the\nnumber of available URBs per error by 1. This leads to reduced performance\nand ultimately to a complete stop of the transmission.\n\nIf the sending of a bulk URB fails do proper cleanup:\n- increase netdev stats\n- mark the echo_sbk as free\n- free the driver's context and do accounting\n- wake the send queue",
