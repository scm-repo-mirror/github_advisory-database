  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe: Fix oops in xe_gem_fault when running core_hotunplug test.\n\nI saw an oops in xe_gem_fault when running the xe-fast-feedback\ntestlist against the realtime kernel without debug options enabled.\n\nThe panic happens after core_hotunplug unbind-rebind finishes.\nPresumably what happens is that a process mmaps, unlocks because\nof the FAULT_FLAG_RETRY_NOWAIT logic, has no process memory left,\ncausing ttm_bo_vm_dummy_page() to return VM_FAULT_NOPAGE, since\nthere was nothing left to populate, and then oopses in\n\"mem_type_is_vram(tbo->resource->mem_type)\" because tbo->resource\nis NULL.\n\nIt's convoluted, but fits the data and explains the oops after\nthe test exits.",
