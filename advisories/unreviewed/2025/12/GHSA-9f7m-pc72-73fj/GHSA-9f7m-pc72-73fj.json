  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nerofs: fix crafted invalid cases for encoded extents\n\nRobert recently reported two corrupted images that can cause system\ncrashes, which are related to the new encoded extents introduced\nin Linux 6.15:\n\n  - The first one [1] has plen != 0 (e.g. plen == 0x2000000) but\n    (plen & Z_EROFS_EXTENT_PLEN_MASK) == 0. It is used to represent\n    special extents such as sparse extents (!EROFS_MAP_MAPPED), but\n    previously only plen == 0 was handled;\n\n  - The second one [2] has pa 0xffffffffffdcffed and plen 0xb4000,\n    then \"cur [0xfffffffffffff000] += bvec.bv_len [0x1000]\" in\n    \"} while ((cur += bvec.bv_len) < end);\" wraps around, causing an\n    out-of-bound access of pcl->compressed_bvecs[] in\n    z_erofs_submit_queue().  EROFS only supports 48-bit physical block\n    addresses (up to 1EiB for 4k blocks), so add a sanity check to\n    enforce this.",
