  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfs4_setup_readdir(): insufficient locking for ->d_parent->d_inode dereferencing\n\nTheoretically it's an oopsable race, but I don't believe one can manage\nto hit it on real hardware; might become doable on a KVM, but it still\nwon't be easy to attack.\n\nAnyway, it's easy to deal with - since xdr_encode_hyper() is just a call of\nput_unaligned_be64(), we can put that under ->d_lock and be done with that.",
