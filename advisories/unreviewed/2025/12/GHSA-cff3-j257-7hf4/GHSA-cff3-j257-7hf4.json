  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: vxlan: prevent NULL deref in vxlan_xmit_one\n\nNeither sock4 nor sock6 pointers are guaranteed to be non-NULL in\nvxlan_xmit_one, e.g. if the iface is brought down. This can lead to the\nfollowing NULL dereference:\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000010\n  Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI\n  RIP: 0010:vxlan_xmit_one+0xbb3/0x1580\n  Call Trace:\n   vxlan_xmit+0x429/0x610\n   dev_hard_start_xmit+0x55/0xa0\n   __dev_queue_xmit+0x6d0/0x7f0\n   ip_finish_output2+0x24b/0x590\n   ip_output+0x63/0x110\n\nMentioned commits changed the code path in vxlan_xmit_one and as a side\neffect the sock4/6 pointer validity checks in vxlan(6)_get_route were\nlost. Fix this by adding back checks.\n\nSince both commits being fixed were released in the same version (v6.7)\nand are strongly related, bundle the fixes in a single commit.",
