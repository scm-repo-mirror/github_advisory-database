  ],
  "details": "A flaw was found in libnbd. A malicious actor could exploit this by convincing libnbd to open a specially crafted Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). This vulnerability arises because non-standard hostnames starting with '-o' are incorrectly interpreted as arguments to the Secure Shell (SSH) process, rather than as hostnames. This could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running libnbd.",
