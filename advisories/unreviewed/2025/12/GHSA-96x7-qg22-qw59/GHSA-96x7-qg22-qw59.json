  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath11k: fix peer HE MCS assignment\n\nIn ath11k_wmi_send_peer_assoc_cmd(), peer's transmit MCS is sent to\nfirmware as receive MCS while peer's receive MCS sent as transmit MCS,\nwhich goes against firmwire's definition.\n\nWhile connecting to a misbehaved AP that advertises 0xffff (meaning not\nsupported) for 160 MHz transmit MCS map, firmware crashes due to 0xffff\nis assigned to he_mcs->rx_mcs_set field.\n\n\tExt Tag: HE Capabilities\n\t    [...]\n\t    Supported HE-MCS and NSS Set\n\t\t[...]\n\t        Rx and Tx MCS Maps 160 MHz\n\t\t    [...]\n\t            Tx HE-MCS Map 160 MHz: 0xffff\n\nSwap the assignment to fix this issue.\n\nAs the HE rate control mask is meant to limit our own transmit MCS, it\nneeds to go via he_mcs->rx_mcs_set field. With the aforementioned swapping\ndone, change is needed as well to apply it to the peer's receive MCS.\n\nTested-on: WCN6855 hw2.1 PCI WLAN.HSP.1.1-03125-QCAHSPSWPL_V1_V2_SILICONZ_LITE-3.6510.41\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.4.1-00199-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1",
