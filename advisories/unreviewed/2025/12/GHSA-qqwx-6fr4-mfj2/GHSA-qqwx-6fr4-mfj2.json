  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkcm: Fix error handling for SOCK_DGRAM in kcm_sendmsg().\n\nsyzkaller found a memory leak in kcm_sendmsg(), and commit c821a88bd720\n(\"kcm: Fix memory leak in error path of kcm_sendmsg()\") suppressed it by\nupdating kcm_tx_msg(head)->last_skb if partial data is copied so that the\nfollowing sendmsg() will resume from the skb.\n\nHowever, we cannot know how many bytes were copied when we get the error.\nThus, we could mess up the MSG_MORE queue.\n\nWhen kcm_sendmsg() fails for SOCK_DGRAM, we should purge the queue as we\ndo so for UDP by udp_flush_pending_frames().\n\nEven without this change, when the error occurred, the following sendmsg()\nresumed from a wrong skb and the queue was messed up.  However, we have\nyet to get such a report, and only syzkaller stumbled on it.  So, this\ncan be changed safely.\n\nNote this does not change SOCK_SEQPACKET behaviour.",
