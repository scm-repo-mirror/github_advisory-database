  "details": "In affected versions, vulnerability-lookup handled user-controlled \ncontent in comments and bundles in an unsafe way, which could lead to \nstored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n\n\n\n\nOn the backend, the related_vulnerabilities field of bundles accepted \narbitrary strings without format validation or proper sanitization. On \nthe frontend, comment and bundle descriptions were converted from \nMarkdown to HTML and then injected directly into the DOM using string \ntemplates and innerHTML. This combination allowed an attacker who could \ncreate or edit comments or bundles to store crafted HTML/JavaScript \npayloads which would later be rendered and executed in the browser of \nany user visiting the affected profile page (user.html). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup: before 2.18.0.",
