  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: ptdma: check for null desc before calling pt_cmd_callback\n\nResolves a panic that can occur on AMD systems, typically during host\nshutdown, after the PTDMA driver had been exercised. The issue was\nthe pt_issue_pending() function is mistakenly assuming that there will\nbe at least one descriptor in the Submitted queue when the function\nis called. However, it is possible that both the Submitted and Issued\nqueues could be empty, which could result in pt_cmd_callback() being\nmistakenly called with a NULL pointer.\nRef: Bugzilla Bug 216856.",
