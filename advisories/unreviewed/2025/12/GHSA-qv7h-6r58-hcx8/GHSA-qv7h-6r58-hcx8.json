  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/radeon: delete radeon_fence_process in is_signaled, no deadlock\n\nDelete the attempt to progress the queue when checking if fence is\nsignaled. This avoids deadlock.\n\ndma-fence_ops::signaled can be called with the fence lock in unknown\nstate. For radeon, the fence lock is also the wait queue lock. This can\ncause a self deadlock when signaled() tries to make forward progress on\nthe wait queue. But advancing the queue is unneeded because incorrectly\nreturning false from signaled() is perfectly acceptable.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 527ba26e50ec2ca2be9c7c82f3ad42998a75d0db)",
