  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nf2fs: fix information leak in f2fs_move_inline_dirents()\n\nWhen converting an inline directory to a regular one, f2fs is leaking\nuninitialized memory to disk because it doesn't initialize the entire\ndirectory block.  Fix this by zero-initializing the block.\n\nThis bug was introduced by commit 4ec17d688d74 (\"f2fs: avoid unneeded\ninitializing when converting inline dentry\"), which didn't consider the\nsecurity implications of leaking uninitialized memory to disk.\n\nThis was found by running xfstest generic/435 on a KMSAN-enabled kernel.",
