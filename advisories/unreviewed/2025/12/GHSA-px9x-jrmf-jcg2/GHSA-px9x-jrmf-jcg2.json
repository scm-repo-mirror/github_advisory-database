  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/net: ensure vectored buffer node import is tied to notification\n\nWhen support for vectored registered buffers was added, the import\nitself is using 'req' rather than the notification io_kiocb, sr->notif.\nFor non-vectored imports, sr->notif is correctly used. This is important\nas the lifetime of the two may be different. Use the correct io_kiocb\nfor the vectored buffer import.",
