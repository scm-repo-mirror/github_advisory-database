  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: micrel: always set shared->phydev for LAN8814\n\nCurrently, during the LAN8814 PTP probe shared->phydev is only set if PTP\nclock gets actually set, otherwise the function will return before setting\nit.\n\nThis is an issue as shared->phydev is unconditionally being used when IRQ\nis being handled, especially in lan8814_gpio_process_cap and since it was\nnot set it will cause a NULL pointer exception and crash the kernel.\n\nSo, simply always set shared->phydev to avoid the NULL pointer exception.",
