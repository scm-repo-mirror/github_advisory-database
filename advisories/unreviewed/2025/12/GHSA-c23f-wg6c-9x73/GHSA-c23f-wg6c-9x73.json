  "details": "The ShopEngine Elementor WooCommerce Builder Addon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.5. This is due to missing nonce validation on the \"post_add_to_list\" function as well as an incorrect permissions callback in the \"Api/init\" function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add or remove products from a user's wishlist via a forged request granted they can trick a site's user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
