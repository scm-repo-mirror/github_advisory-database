  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: realtek: fix out-of-bounds access\n\nThe probe function sets priv->chip_data to (void *)priv + sizeof(*priv)\nwith the expectation that priv has enough trailing space.\n\nHowever, only realtek-smi actually allocated this chip_data space.\nDo likewise in realtek-mdio to fix out-of-bounds accesses.\n\nThese accesses likely went unnoticed so far, because of an (unused)\nbuf[4096] member in struct realtek_priv, which caused kmalloc to\nround up the allocated buffer to a big enough size, so nothing of\nvalue was overwritten. With a different allocator (like in the barebox\nbootloader port of the driver) or with KASAN, the memory corruption\nbecomes quickly apparent.",
