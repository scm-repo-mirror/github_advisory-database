  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: use hdev->workqueue when queuing hdev->{cmd,ncmd}_timer works\n\nsyzbot is reporting attempt to schedule hdev->cmd_work work from system_wq\nWQ into hdev->workqueue WQ which is under draining operation [1], for\ncommit c8efcc2589464ac7 (\"workqueue: allow chained queueing during\ndestruction\") does not allow such operation.\n\nThe check introduced by commit 877afadad2dce8aa (\"Bluetooth: When HCI work\nqueue is drained, only queue chained work\") was incomplete.\n\nUse hdev->workqueue WQ when queuing hdev->{cmd,ncmd}_timer works because\nhci_{cmd,ncmd}_timeout() calls queue_work(hdev->workqueue). Also, protect\nthe queuing operation with RCU read lock in order to avoid calling\nqueue_delayed_work() after cancel_delayed_work() completed.",
