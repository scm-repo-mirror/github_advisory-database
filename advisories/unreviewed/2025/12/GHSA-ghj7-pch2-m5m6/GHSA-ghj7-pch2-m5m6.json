  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: tegra210-quad: Fix timeout handling\n\nWhen the CPU that the QSPI interrupt handler runs on (typically CPU 0)\nis excessively busy, it can lead to rare cases of the IRQ thread not\nrunning before the transfer timeout is reached.\n\nWhile handling the timeouts, any pending transfers are cleaned up and\nthe message that they correspond to is marked as failed, which leaves\nthe curr_xfer field pointing at stale memory.\n\nTo avoid this, clear curr_xfer to NULL upon timeout and check for this\ncondition when the IRQ thread is finally run.\n\nWhile at it, also make sure to clear interrupts on failure so that new\ninterrupts can be run.\n\nA better, more involved, fix would move the interrupt clearing into a\nhard IRQ handler. Ideally we would also want to signal that the IRQ\nthread no longer needs to be run after the timeout is hit to avoid the\nextra check for a valid transfer.",
