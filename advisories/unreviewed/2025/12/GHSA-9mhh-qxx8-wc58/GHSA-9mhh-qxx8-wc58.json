  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexfat: validate cluster allocation bits of the allocation bitmap\n\nsyzbot created an exfat image with cluster bits not set for the allocation\nbitmap. exfat-fs reads and uses the allocation bitmap without checking\nthis. The problem is that if the start cluster of the allocation bitmap\nis 6, cluster 6 can be allocated when creating a directory with mkdir.\nexfat zeros out this cluster in exfat_mkdir, which can delete existing\nentries. This can reallocate the allocated entries. In addition,\nthe allocation bitmap is also zeroed out, so cluster 6 can be reallocated.\nThis patch adds exfat_test_bitmap_range to validate that clusters used for\nthe allocation bitmap are correctly marked as in-use.",
