  "details": "The Hide Email Address plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'inline_css' parameter in the `bg-hide-email-address` shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
