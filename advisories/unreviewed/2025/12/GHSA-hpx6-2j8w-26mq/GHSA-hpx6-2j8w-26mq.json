  "details": "The mobile application is configured to allow clear text traffic to all domains and communicates with an API server over HTTP. As a result, an adversary located \"upstream\" can intercept the traffic, inspect its contents, and modify the requests in transit. TThis may result in a total compromise of the user's account if the attacker intercepts a request with active authentication tokens or cracks the MD5 hash sent on login.",
