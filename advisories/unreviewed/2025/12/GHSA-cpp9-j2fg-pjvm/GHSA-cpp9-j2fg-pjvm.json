  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncoresight: ETR: Fix ETR buffer use-after-free issue\n\nWhen ETR is enabled as CS_MODE_SYSFS, if the buffer size is changed\nand enabled again, currently sysfs_buf will point to the newly\nallocated memory(buf_new) and free the old memory(buf_old). But the\netr_buf that is being used by the ETR remains pointed to buf_old, not\nupdated to buf_new. In this case, it will result in a memory\nuse-after-free issue.\n\nFix this by checking ETR's mode before updating and releasing buf_old,\nif the mode is CS_MODE_SYSFS, then skip updating and releasing it.",
