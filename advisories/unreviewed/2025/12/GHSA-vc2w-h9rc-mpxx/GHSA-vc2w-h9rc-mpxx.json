  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: qla2xxx: Clear cmds after chip reset\n\nCommit aefed3e5548f (\"scsi: qla2xxx: target: Fix offline port handling\nand host reset handling\") caused two problems:\n\n1. Commands sent to FW, after chip reset got stuck and never freed as FW\n   is not going to respond to them anymore.\n\n2. BUG_ON(cmd->sg_mapped) in qlt_free_cmd().  Commit 26f9ce53817a\n   (\"scsi: qla2xxx: Fix missed DMA unmap for aborted commands\")\n   attempted to fix this, but introduced another bug under different\n   circumstances when two different CPUs were racing to call\n   qlt_unmap_sg() at the same time: BUG_ON(!valid_dma_direction(dir)) in\n   dma_unmap_sg_attrs().\n\nSo revert \"scsi: qla2xxx: Fix missed DMA unmap for aborted commands\" and\npartially revert \"scsi: qla2xxx: target: Fix offline port handling and\nhost reset handling\" at __qla2x00_abort_all_cmds.",
