  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: hda/hdmi: Fix breakage at probing nvhdmi-mcp driver\n\nAfter restructuring and splitting the HDMI codec driver code, each\nHDMI codec driver contains the own build_controls and build_pcms ops.\nA copy-n-paste error put the wrong entries for nvhdmi-mcp driver; both\nbuild_controls and build_pcms are swapped.  Unfortunately both\ncallbacks have the very same form, and the compiler didn't complain\nit, either.  This resulted in a NULL dereference because the PCM\ninstance hasn't been initialized at calling the build_controls\ncallback.\n\nFix it by passing the proper entries.",
