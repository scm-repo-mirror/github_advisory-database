  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmost: usb: Fix use-after-free in hdm_disconnect\n\nhdm_disconnect() calls most_deregister_interface(), which eventually\nunregisters the MOST interface device with device_unregister(iface->dev).\nIf that drops the last reference, the device core may call release_mdev()\nimmediately while hdm_disconnect() is still executing.\n\nThe old code also freed several mdev-owned allocations in\nhdm_disconnect() and then performed additional put_device() calls.\nDepending on refcount order, this could lead to use-after-free or\ndouble-free when release_mdev() ran (or when unregister paths also\nperformed puts).\n\nFix by moving the frees of mdev-owned allocations into release_mdev(),\nso they happen exactly once when the device is truly released, and by\ndropping the extra put_device() calls in hdm_disconnect() that are\nredundant after device_unregister() and most_deregister_interface().\n\nThis addresses the KASAN slab-use-after-free reported by syzbot in\nhdm_disconnect(). See report and stack traces in the bug link below.",
