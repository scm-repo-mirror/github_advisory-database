  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: stmmac: Correctly handle Rx checksum offload errors\n\nThe stmmac_rx function would previously set skb->ip_summed to\nCHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY if hardware checksum offload (CoE) was enabled\nand the packet was of a known IP ethertype.\n\nHowever, this logic failed to check if the hardware had actually\nreported a checksum error. The hardware status, indicating a header or\npayload checksum failure, was being ignored at this stage. This could\ncause corrupt packets to be passed up the network stack as valid.\n\nThis patch corrects the logic by checking the `csum_none` status flag,\nwhich is set when the hardware reports a checksum error. If this flag\nis set, skb->ip_summed is now correctly set to CHECKSUM_NONE,\nensuring the kernel's network stack will perform its own validation and\nproperly handle the corrupt packet.",
