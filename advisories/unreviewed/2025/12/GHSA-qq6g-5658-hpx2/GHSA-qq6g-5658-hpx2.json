  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsoundwire: bus: Fix unbalanced pm_runtime_put() causing usage count underflow\n\nThis reverts commit\n443a98e649b4 (\"soundwire: bus: use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()\")\n\nChange calls to pm_runtime_resume_and_get() back to pm_runtime_get_sync().\nThis fixes a usage count underrun caused by doing a pm_runtime_put() even\nthough pm_runtime_resume_and_get() returned an error.\n\nThe three affected functions ignore -EACCES error from trying to get\npm_runtime, and carry on, including a put at the end of the function.\nBut pm_runtime_resume_and_get() does not increment the usage count if it\nreturns an error. So in the -EACCES case you must not call\npm_runtime_put().\n\nThe documentation for pm_runtime_get_sync() says:\n \"Consider using pm_runtime_resume_and_get() ...  as this is likely to\n result in cleaner code.\"\n\nIn this case I don't think it results in cleaner code because the\npm_runtime_put() at the end of the function would have to be conditional on\nthe return value from pm_runtime_resume_and_get() at the top of the\nfunction.\n\npm_runtime_get_sync() doesn't have this problem because it always\nincrements the count, so always needs a put. The code can just flow through\nand do the pm_runtime_put() unconditionally.",
