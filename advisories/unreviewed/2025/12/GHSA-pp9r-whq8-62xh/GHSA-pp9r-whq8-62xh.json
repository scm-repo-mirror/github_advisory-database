  "details": "The WP CarDealer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.16. This is due to the 'WP_CarDealer_User::process_register' function not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the 'administrator' role during registration and gain administrator access to the site.",
