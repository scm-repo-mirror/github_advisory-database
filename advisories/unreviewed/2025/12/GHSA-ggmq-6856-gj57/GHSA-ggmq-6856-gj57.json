  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstaging: rtl8723bs: fix out-of-bounds read in OnBeacon ESR IE parsing\n\nThe Extended Supported Rates (ESR) IE handling in OnBeacon accessed\n*(p + 1 + ielen) and *(p + 2 + ielen) without verifying that these\noffsets lie within the received frame buffer. A malformed beacon with\nan ESR IE positioned at the end of the buffer could cause an\nout-of-bounds read, potentially triggering a kernel panic.\n\nAdd a boundary check to ensure that the ESR IE body and the subsequent\nbytes are within the limits of the frame before attempting to access\nthem.\n\nThis prevents OOB reads caused by malformed beacon frames.",
