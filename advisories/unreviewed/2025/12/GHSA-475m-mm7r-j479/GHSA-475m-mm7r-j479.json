  ],
  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: potential integer overflow in usbg_make_tpg()\n\nThe variable tpgt in usbg_make_tpg() is defined as unsigned long and is\nassigned to tpgt->tport_tpgt, which is defined as u16. This may cause an\ninteger overflow when tpgt is greater than USHRT_MAX (65535). I\nhaven't tried to trigger it myself, but it is possible to trigger it\nby calling usbg_make_tpg() with a large value for tpgt.\n\nI modified the type of tpgt to match tpgt->tport_tpgt and adjusted the\nrelevant code accordingly.\n\nThis patch is similar to commit 59c816c1f24d (\"vhost/scsi: potential\nmemory corruption\").",
