  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrv: Fully convert enabled_monitors to use list_head as iterator\n\nThe callbacks in enabled_monitors_seq_ops are inconsistent. Some treat the\niterator as struct rv_monitor *, while others treat the iterator as struct\nlist_head *.\n\nThis causes a wrong type cast and crashes the system as reported by Nathan.\n\nConvert everything to use struct list_head * as iterator. This also makes\nenabled_monitors consistent with available_monitors.",
