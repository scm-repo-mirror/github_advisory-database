  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: core: Prevent invalid memory access when there is no parent\n\nCommit 813665564b3d (\"iio: core: Convert to use firmware node handle\ninstead of OF node\") switched the kind of nodes to use for label\nretrieval in device registration.  Probably an unwanted change in that\ncommit was that if the device has no parent then NULL pointer is\naccessed.  This is what happens in the stock IIO dummy driver when a\nnew entry is created in configfs:\n\n  # mkdir /sys/kernel/config/iio/devices/dummy/foo\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: ...\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n  __iio_device_register\n  iio_dummy_probe\n\nSince there seems to be no reason to make a parent device of an IIO\ndummy device mandatory, let’s prevent the invalid memory access in\n__iio_device_register when the parent device is NULL.  With this\nchange, the IIO dummy driver works fine with configfs.",
