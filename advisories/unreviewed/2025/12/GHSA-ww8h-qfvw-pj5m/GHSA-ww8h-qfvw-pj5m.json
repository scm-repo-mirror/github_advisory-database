  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64/pageattr: Propagate return value from __change_memory_common\n\nThe rodata=on security measure requires that any code path which does\nvmalloc -> set_memory_ro/set_memory_rox must protect the linear map alias\ntoo. Therefore, if such a call fails, we must abort set_memory_* and caller\nmust take appropriate action; currently we are suppressing the error, and\nthere is a real chance of such an error arising post commit a166563e7ec3\n(\"arm64: mm: support large block mapping when rodata=full\"). Therefore,\npropagate any error to the caller.",
