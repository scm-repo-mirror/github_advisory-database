  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/dpu: Disallow unallocated resources to be returned\n\nIn the event that the topology requests resources that have not been\ncreated by the system (because they are typically not represented in\ndpu_mdss_cfg ^1), the resource(s) in global_state (in this case DSC\nblocks, until their allocation/assignment is being sanity-checked in\n\"drm/msm/dpu: Reject topologies for which no DSC blocks are available\")\nremain NULL but will still be returned out of\ndpu_rm_get_assigned_resources, where the caller expects to get an array\ncontaining num_blks valid pointers (but instead gets these NULLs).\n\nTo prevent this from happening, where null-pointer dereferences\ntypically result in a hard-to-debug platform lockup, num_blks shouldn't\nincrease past NULL blocks and will print an error and break instead.\nAfter all, max_blks represents the static size of the maximum number of\nblocks whereas the actual amount varies per platform.\n\n^1: which can happen after a git rebase ended up moving additions to\n_dpu_cfg to a different struct which has the same patch context.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/517636/",
