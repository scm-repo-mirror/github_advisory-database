  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbnxt_en: Shutdown FW DMA in bnxt_shutdown()\n\nThe netif_close() call in bnxt_shutdown() only stops packet DMA.  There\nmay be FW DMA for trace logging (recently added) that will continue.  If\nwe kexec to a new kernel, the DMA will corrupt memory in the new kernel.\n\nAdd bnxt_hwrm_func_drv_unrgtr() to unregister the driver from the FW.\nThis will stop the FW DMA.  In case the call fails, call pcie_flr() to\nreset the function and stop the DMA.",
