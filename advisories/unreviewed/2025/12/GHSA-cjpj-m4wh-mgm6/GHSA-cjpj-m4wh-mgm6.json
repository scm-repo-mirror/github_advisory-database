  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetconsole: Acquire su_mutex before navigating configs hierarchy\n\nThere is a race between operations that iterate over the userdata\ncg_children list and concurrent add/remove of userdata items through\nconfigfs. The update_userdata() function iterates over the\nnt->userdata_group.cg_children list, and count_extradata_entries() also\niterates over this same list to count nodes.\n\nQuoting from Documentation/filesystems/configfs.rst:\n> A subsystem can navigate the cg_children list and the ci_parent pointer\n> to see the tree created by the subsystem.  This can race with configfs'\n> management of the hierarchy, so configfs uses the subsystem mutex to\n> protect modifications.  Whenever a subsystem wants to navigate the\n> hierarchy, it must do so under the protection of the subsystem\n> mutex.\n\nWithout proper locking, if a userdata item is added or removed\nconcurrently while these functions are iterating, the list can be\naccessed in an inconsistent state. For example, the list_for_each() loop\ncan reach a node that is being removed from the list by list_del_init()\nwhich sets the nodes' .next pointer to point to itself, so the loop will\nnever end (or reach the WARN_ON_ONCE in update_userdata() ).\n\nFix this by holding the configfs subsystem mutex (su_mutex) during all\noperations that iterate over cg_children.\nThis includes:\n- userdatum_value_store() which calls update_userdata() to iterate over\n  cg_children\n- All sysdata_*_enabled_store() functions which call\n  count_extradata_entries() to iterate over cg_children\n\nThe su_mutex must be acquired before dynamic_netconsole_mutex to avoid\npotential lock ordering issues, as configfs operations may already hold\nsu_mutex when calling into our code.",
