  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: VMX: Fix crash due to uninitialized current_vmcs\n\nKVM enables 'Enlightened VMCS' and 'Enlightened MSR Bitmap' when running as\na nested hypervisor on top of Hyper-V. When MSR bitmap is updated,\nevmcs_touch_msr_bitmap function uses current_vmcs per-cpu variable to mark\nthat the msr bitmap was changed.\n\nvmx_vcpu_create() modifies the msr bitmap via vmx_disable_intercept_for_msr\n-> vmx_msr_bitmap_l01_changed which in the end calls this function. The\nfunction checks for current_vmcs if it is null but the check is\ninsufficient because current_vmcs is not initialized. Because of this, the\ncode might incorrectly write to the structure pointed by current_vmcs value\nleft by another task. Preemption is not disabled, the current task can be\npreempted and moved to another CPU while current_vmcs is accessed multiple\ntimes from evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap() which leads to crash.\n\nThe manipulation of MSR bitmaps by callers happens only for vmcs01 so the\nsolution is to use vmx->vmcs01.vmcs instead of current_vmcs.\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000338\n  PGD 4e1775067 P4D 0\n  Oops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\n  ...\n  RIP: 0010:vmx_msr_bitmap_l01_changed+0x39/0x50 [kvm_intel]\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n   vmx_disable_intercept_for_msr+0x36/0x260 [kvm_intel]\n   vmx_vcpu_create+0xe6/0x540 [kvm_intel]\n   kvm_arch_vcpu_create+0x1d1/0x2e0 [kvm]\n   kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu+0x178/0x430 [kvm]\n   kvm_vm_ioctl+0x53f/0x790 [kvm]\n   __x64_sys_ioctl+0x8a/0xc0\n   do_syscall_64+0x5c/0x90\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd",
