  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmisc: fastrpc: Fix dma_buf object leak in fastrpc_map_lookup\n\nIn fastrpc_map_lookup, dma_buf_get is called to obtain a reference to\nthe dma_buf for comparison purposes. However, this reference is never\nreleased when the function returns, leading to a dma_buf memory leak.\n\nFix this by adding dma_buf_put before returning from the function,\nensuring that the temporarily acquired reference is properly released\nregardless of whether a matching map is found.\n\nRule: add",
