  "details": "The Deployment Infrastructure in Mintlify Platform before 2025-11-15 allows remote attackers to bypass security patches and execute downgrade attacks via predictable deployment identifiers on the Vercel preview domain. An attacker can identify the URL structure of a previous deployment that contains unpatched vulnerabilities. By browsing directly to the specific git-ref or deployment-id subdomain, the attacker can force the application to load the vulnerable version.",
