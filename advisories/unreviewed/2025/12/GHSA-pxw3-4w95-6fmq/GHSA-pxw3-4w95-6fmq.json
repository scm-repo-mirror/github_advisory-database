  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhung_task: fix warnings caused by unaligned lock pointers\n\nThe blocker tracking mechanism assumes that lock pointers are at least\n4-byte aligned to use their lower bits for type encoding.\n\nHowever, as reported by Eero Tamminen, some architectures like m68k\nonly guarantee 2-byte alignment of 32-bit values. This breaks the\nassumption and causes two related WARN_ON_ONCE checks to trigger.\n\nTo fix this, the runtime checks are adjusted to silently ignore any lock\nthat is not 4-byte aligned, effectively disabling the feature in such\ncases and avoiding the related warnings.\n\nThanks to Geert Uytterhoeven for bisecting!",
