  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/huge_memory: fix NULL pointer deference when splitting folio\n\nCommit c010d47f107f (\"mm: thp: split huge page to any lower order pages\")\nintroduced an early check on the folio's order via mapping->flags before\nproceeding with the split work.\n\nThis check introduced a bug: for shmem folios in the swap cache and\ntruncated folios, the mapping pointer can be NULL.  Accessing\nmapping->flags in this state leads directly to a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThis commit fixes the issue by moving the check for mapping != NULL before\nany attempt to access mapping->flags.",
