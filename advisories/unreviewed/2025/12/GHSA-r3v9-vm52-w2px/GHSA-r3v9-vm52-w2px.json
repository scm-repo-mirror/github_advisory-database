  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/pseries: Rework lppaca_shared_proc() to avoid DEBUG_PREEMPT\n\nlppaca_shared_proc() takes a pointer to the lppaca which is typically\naccessed through get_lppaca().  With DEBUG_PREEMPT enabled, this leads\nto checking if preemption is enabled, for example:\n\n  BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: grep/10693\n  caller is lparcfg_data+0x408/0x19a0\n  CPU: 4 PID: 10693 Comm: grep Not tainted 6.5.0-rc3 #2\n  Call Trace:\n    dump_stack_lvl+0x154/0x200 (unreliable)\n    check_preemption_disabled+0x214/0x220\n    lparcfg_data+0x408/0x19a0\n    ...\n\nThis isn't actually a problem however, as it does not matter which\nlppaca is accessed, the shared proc state will be the same.\nvcpudispatch_stats_procfs_init() already works around this by disabling\npreemption, but the lparcfg code does not, erroring any time\n/proc/powerpc/lparcfg is accessed with DEBUG_PREEMPT enabled.\n\nInstead of disabling preemption on the caller side, rework\nlppaca_shared_proc() to not take a pointer and instead directly access\nthe lppaca, bypassing any potential preemption checks.\n\n[mpe: Rework to avoid needing a definition in paca.h and lppaca.h]",
