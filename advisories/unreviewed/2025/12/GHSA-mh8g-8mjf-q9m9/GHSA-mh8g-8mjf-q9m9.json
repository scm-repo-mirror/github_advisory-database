  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd: avoid repeated calls to del_gendisk\n\nThere is a uaf problem which is found by case 23rdev-lifetime:\n\nOops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000122\nRIP: 0010:bdi_unregister+0x4b/0x170\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n __del_gendisk+0x356/0x3e0\n mddev_unlock+0x351/0x360\n rdev_attr_store+0x217/0x280\n kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x14a/0x210\n vfs_write+0x29e/0x550\n ksys_write+0x74/0xf0\n do_syscall_64+0xbb/0x380\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\nRIP: 0033:0x7ff5250a177e\n\nThe sequence is:\n1. rdev remove path gets reconfig_mutex\n2. rdev remove path release reconfig_mutex in mddev_unlock\n3. md stop calls do_md_stop and sets MD_DELETED\n4. rdev remove path calls del_gendisk because MD_DELETED is set\n5. md stop path release reconfig_mutex and calls del_gendisk again\n\nSo there is a race condition we should resolve. This patch adds a\nflag MD_DO_DELETE to avoid the race condition.",
