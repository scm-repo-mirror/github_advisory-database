  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/panthor: Fix UAF race between device unplug and FW event processing\n\nThe function panthor_fw_unplug() will free the FW memory sections.\nThe problem is that there could still be pending FW events which are yet\nnot handled at this point. process_fw_events_work() can in this case try\nto access said freed memory.\n\nSimply call disable_work_sync() to both drain and prevent future\ninvocation of process_fw_events_work().",
