  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nerofs: kill hooked chains to avoid loops on deduplicated compressed images\n\nAfter heavily stressing EROFS with several images which include a\nhand-crafted image of repeated patterns for more than 46 days, I found\ntwo chains could be linked with each other almost simultaneously and\nform a loop so that the entire loop won't be submitted.  As a\nconsequence, the corresponding file pages will remain locked forever.\n\nIt can be _only_ observed on data-deduplicated compressed images.\nFor example, consider two chains with five pclusters in total:\n\tChain 1:  2->3->4->5    -- The tail pcluster is 5;\n        Chain 2:  5->1->2       -- The tail pcluster is 2.\n\nChain 2 could link to Chain 1 with pcluster 5; and Chain 1 could link\nto Chain 2 at the same time with pcluster 2.\n\nSince hooked chains are all linked locklessly now, I have no idea how\nto simply avoid the race.  Instead, let's avoid hooked chains completely\nuntil I could work out a proper way to fix this and end users finally\ntell us that it's needed to add it back.\n\nActually, this optimization can be found with multi-threaded workloads\n(especially even more often on deduplicated compressed images), yet I'm\nnot sure about the overall system impacts of not having this compared\nwith implementation complexity.",
