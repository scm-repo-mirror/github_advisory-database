  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: fix memory leak when removing provided buffers\n\nWhen removing provided buffers, io_buffer structs are not being disposed\nof, leading to a memory leak. They can't be freed individually, because\nthey are allocated in page-sized groups. They need to be added to some\nfree list instead, such as io_buffers_cache. All callers already hold\nthe lock protecting it, apart from when destroying buffers, so had to\nextend the lock there.",
