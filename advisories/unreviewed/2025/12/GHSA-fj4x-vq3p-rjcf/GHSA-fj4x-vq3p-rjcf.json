By performing a memory dump on the application after a user has logged out and terminated it, Wi-Fi credentials sent during the pairing process, JWTs used for authentication, and other sensitive details can be retrieved. As a result, an attacker with physical access to the device of a victim can retrieve this information and gain unauthorized access to their home Wi-Fi network and Meatmeet account.",
