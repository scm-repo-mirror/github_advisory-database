  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-mq: release crypto keyslot before reporting I/O complete\n\nOnce all I/O using a blk_crypto_key has completed, filesystems can call\nblk_crypto_evict_key().  However, the block layer currently doesn't call\nblk_crypto_put_keyslot() until the request is being freed, which happens\nafter upper layers have been told (via bio_endio()) the I/O has\ncompleted.  This causes a race condition where blk_crypto_evict_key()\ncan see 'slot_refs != 0' without there being an actual bug.\n\nThis makes __blk_crypto_evict_key() hit the\n'WARN_ON_ONCE(atomic_read(&slot->slot_refs) != 0)' and return without\ndoing anything, eventually causing a use-after-free in\nblk_crypto_reprogram_all_keys().  (This is a very rare bug and has only\nbeen seen when per-file keys are being used with fscrypt.)\n\nThere are two options to fix this: either release the keyslot before\nbio_endio() is called on the request's last bio, or make\n__blk_crypto_evict_key() ignore slot_refs.  Let's go with the first\nsolution, since it preserves the ability to report bugs (via\nWARN_ON_ONCE) where a key is evicted while still in-use.",
