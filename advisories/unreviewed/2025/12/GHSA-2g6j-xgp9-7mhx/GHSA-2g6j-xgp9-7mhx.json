  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nplatform/x86: int3472: Fix double free of GPIO device during unregister\n\nregulator_unregister() already frees the associated GPIO device. On\nThinkPad X9 (Lunar Lake), this causes a double free issue that leads to\nrandom failures when other drivers (typically Intel THC) attempt to\nallocate interrupts. The root cause is that the reference count of the\npinctrl_intel_platform module unexpectedly drops to zero when this\ndriver defers its probe.\n\nThis behavior can also be reproduced by unloading the module directly.\n\nFix the issue by removing the redundant release of the GPIO device\nduring regulator unregistration.",
