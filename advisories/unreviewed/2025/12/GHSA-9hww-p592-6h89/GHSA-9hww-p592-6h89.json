  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: fix memory leak in __blkdev_issue_zero_pages\n\nMove the fatal signal check before bio_alloc() to prevent a memory\nleak when BLKDEV_ZERO_KILLABLE is set and a fatal signal is pending.\n\nPreviously, the bio was allocated before checking for a fatal signal.\nIf a signal was pending, the code would break out of the loop without\nfreeing or chaining the just-allocated bio, causing a memory leak.\n\nThis matches the pattern already used in __blkdev_issue_write_zeroes()\nwhere the signal check precedes the allocation.",
