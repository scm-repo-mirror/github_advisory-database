  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndebugobjects: Don't wake up kswapd from fill_pool()\n\nsyzbot is reporting a lockdep warning in fill_pool() because the allocation\nfrom debugobjects is using GFP_ATOMIC, which is (__GFP_HIGH | __GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM)\nand therefore tries to wake up kswapd, which acquires kswapd_wait::lock.\n\nSince fill_pool() might be called with arbitrary locks held, fill_pool()\nshould not assume that acquiring kswapd_wait::lock is safe.\n\nUse __GFP_HIGH instead and remove __GFP_NORETRY as it is pointless for\n!__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM allocation.",
