  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd: fix rcu protection in md_wakeup_thread\n\nWe attempted to use RCU to protect the pointer 'thread', but directly\npassed the value when calling md_wakeup_thread(). This means that the\nRCU pointer has been acquired before rcu_read_lock(), which renders\nrcu_read_lock() ineffective and could lead to a use-after-free.",
