  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: atmel-quadspi: Free resources even if runtime resume failed in .remove()\n\nAn early error exit in atmel_qspi_remove() doesn't prevent the device\nunbind. So this results in an spi controller with an unbound parent\nand unmapped register space (because devm_ioremap_resource() is undone).\nSo using the remaining spi controller probably results in an oops.\n\nInstead unregister the controller unconditionally and only skip hardware\naccess and clk disable.\n\nAlso add a warning about resume failing and return zero unconditionally.\nThe latter has the only effect to suppress a less helpful error message by\nthe spi core.",
