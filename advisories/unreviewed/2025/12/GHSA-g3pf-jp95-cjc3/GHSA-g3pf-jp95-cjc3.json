  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naccel/habanalabs: support mapping cb with vmalloc-backed coherent memory\n\nWhen IOMMU is enabled, dma_alloc_coherent() with GFP_USER may return\naddresses from the vmalloc range. If such an address is mapped without\nVM_MIXEDMAP, vm_insert_page() will trigger a BUG_ON due to the\nVM_PFNMAP restriction.\n\nFix this by checking for vmalloc addresses and setting VM_MIXEDMAP\nin the VMA before mapping. This ensures safe mapping and avoids kernel\ncrashes. The memory is still driver-allocated and cannot be accessed\ndirectly by userspace.",
