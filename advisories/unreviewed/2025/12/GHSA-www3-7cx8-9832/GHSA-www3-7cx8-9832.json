  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: prevent leak of lsm program after failed attach\n\nIn [0], we added the ability to bpf_prog_attach LSM programs to cgroups,\nbut in our validation to make sure the prog is meant to be attached to\nBPF_LSM_CGROUP, we return too early if the check fails. This results in\nlack of decrementing prog's refcnt (through bpf_prog_put)\nleaving the LSM program alive past the point of the expected lifecycle.\nThis fix allows for the decrement to take place.\n\n[0] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220628174314.1216643-4-sdf@google.com/",
