  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nring-buffer: Do not warn in ring_buffer_map_get_reader() when reader catches up\n\nThe function ring_buffer_map_get_reader() is a bit more strict than the\nother get reader functions, and except for certain situations the\nrb_get_reader_page() should not return NULL. If it does, it triggers a\nwarning.\n\nThis warning was triggering but after looking at why, it was because\nanother acceptable situation was happening and it wasn't checked for.\n\nIf the reader catches up to the writer and there's still data to be read\non the reader page, then the rb_get_reader_page() will return NULL as\nthere's no new page to get.\n\nIn this situation, the reader page should not be updated and no warning\nshould trigger.",
