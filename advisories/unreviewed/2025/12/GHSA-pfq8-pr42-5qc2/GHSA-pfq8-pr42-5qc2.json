  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/vfio-ap: fix memory leak in vfio_ap device driver\n\nThe device release callback function invoked to release the matrix device\nuses the dev_get_drvdata(device *dev) function to retrieve the\npointer to the vfio_matrix_dev object in order to free its storage. The\nproblem is, this object is not stored as drvdata with the device; since the\nkfree function will accept a NULL pointer, the memory for the\nvfio_matrix_dev object is never freed.\n\nSince the device being released is contained within the vfio_matrix_dev\nobject, the container_of macro will be used to retrieve its pointer.",
