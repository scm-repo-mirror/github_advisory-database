  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Fix WARN_ON in tracing_buffers_mmap_close for split VMAs\n\nWhen a VMA is split (e.g., by partial munmap or MAP_FIXED), the kernel\ncalls vm_ops->close on each portion. For trace buffer mappings, this\nresults in ring_buffer_unmap() being called multiple times while\nring_buffer_map() was only called once.\n\nThis causes ring_buffer_unmap() to return -ENODEV on subsequent calls\nbecause user_mapped is already 0, triggering a WARN_ON.\n\nTrace buffer mappings cannot support partial mappings because the ring\nbuffer structure requires the complete buffer including the meta page.\n\nFix this by adding a may_split callback that returns -EINVAL to prevent\nVMA splits entirely.",
