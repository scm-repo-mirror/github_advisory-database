  ],
  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfsnotify: do not generate ACCESS/MODIFY events on child for special files\n\ninotify/fanotify do not allow users with no read access to a file to\nsubscribe to events (e.g. IN_ACCESS/IN_MODIFY), but they do allow the\nsame user to subscribe for watching events on children when the user\nhas access to the parent directory (e.g. /dev).\n\nUsers with no read access to a file but with read access to its parent\ndirectory can still stat the file and see if it was accessed/modified\nvia atime/mtime change.\n\nThe same is not true for special files (e.g. /dev/null). Users will not\ngenerally observe atime/mtime changes when other users read/write to\nspecial files, only when someone sets atime/mtime via utimensat().\n\nAlign fsnotify events with this stat behavior and do not generate\nACCESS/MODIFY events to parent watchers on read/write of special files.\nThe events are still generated to parent watchers on utimensat(). This\ncloses some side-channels that could be possibly used for information\nexfiltration [1].\n\n[1] https://snee.la/pdf/pubs/file-notification-attacks.pdf",
