  "details": "A flaw was identified in the RelaxNG parser of libxml2 related to how external schema inclusions are handled. The parser does not enforce a limit on inclusion depth when resolving nested <include> directives. Specially crafted or overly complex schemas can cause excessive recursion during parsing. This may lead to stack exhaustion and application crashes, creating a denial-of-service risk.",
