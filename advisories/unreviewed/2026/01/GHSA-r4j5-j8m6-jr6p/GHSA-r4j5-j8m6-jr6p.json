  "details": "An issue was discovered in Nitro PDF Pro for Windows before 14.42.0.34. In certain cases, it displays signer information from a non-verified PDF field rather than from the verified certificate subject. This could allow a document to present inconsistent signer details. The display logic was updated to ensure signer information consistently reflects the verified certificate identity.",
