  "details": "GPT Academic stream_daas Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GPT Academic. Interaction with a malicious DAAS server is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the stream_daas function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-27956.",
