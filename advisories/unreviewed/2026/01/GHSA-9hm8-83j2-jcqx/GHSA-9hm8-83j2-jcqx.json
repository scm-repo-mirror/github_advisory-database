  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: vidtv: initialize local pointers upon transfer of memory ownership\n\nvidtv_channel_si_init() creates a temporary list (program, service, event)\nand ownership of the memory itself is transferred to the PAT/SDT/EIT\ntables through vidtv_psi_pat_program_assign(),\nvidtv_psi_sdt_service_assign(), vidtv_psi_eit_event_assign().\n\nThe problem here is that the local pointer where the memory ownership\ntransfer was completed is not initialized to NULL. This causes the\nvidtv_psi_pmt_create_sec_for_each_pat_entry() function to fail, and\nin the flow that jumps to free_eit, the memory that was freed by\nvidtv_psi_*_table_destroy() can be accessed again by\nvidtv_psi_*_event_destroy() due to the uninitialized local pointer, so it\nis freed once again.\n\nTherefore, to prevent use-after-free and double-free vulnerability,\nlocal pointers must be initialized to NULL when transferring memory\nownership.",
