  "details": "Issue summary: If an application using the SSL_CIPHER_find() function in\na QUIC protocol client or server receives an unknown cipher suite from\nthe peer, a NULL dereference occurs.\n\nImpact summary: A NULL pointer dereference leads to abnormal termination of\nthe running process causing Denial of Service.\n\nSome applications call SSL_CIPHER_find() from the client_hello_cb callback\non the cipher ID received from the peer. If this is done with an SSL object\nimplementing the QUIC protocol, NULL pointer dereference will happen if\nthe examined cipher ID is unknown or unsupported.\n\nAs it is not very common to call this function in applications using the QUIC \nprotocol and the worst outcome is Denial of Service, the issue was assessed\nas Low severity.\n\nThe vulnerable code was introduced in the 3.2 version with the addition\nof the QUIC protocol support.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4 and 3.3 are not affected by this issue,\nas the QUIC implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4 and 3.3 are vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue.",
