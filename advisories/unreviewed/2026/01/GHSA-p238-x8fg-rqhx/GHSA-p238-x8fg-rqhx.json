  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: fix nfsd_file reference leak in nfsd4_add_rdaccess_to_wrdeleg()\n\nnfsd4_add_rdaccess_to_wrdeleg() unconditionally overwrites\nfp->fi_fds[O_RDONLY] with a newly acquired nfsd_file. However, if\nthe client already has a SHARE_ACCESS_READ open from a previous OPEN\noperation, this action overwrites the existing pointer without\nreleasing its reference, orphaning the previous reference.\n\nAdditionally, the function originally stored the same nfsd_file\npointer in both fp->fi_fds[O_RDONLY] and fp->fi_rdeleg_file with\nonly a single reference. When put_deleg_file() runs, it clears\nfi_rdeleg_file and calls nfs4_file_put_access() to release the file.\n\nHowever, nfs4_file_put_access() only releases fi_fds[O_RDONLY] when\nthe fi_access[O_RDONLY] counter drops to zero. If another READ open\nexists on the file, the counter remains elevated and the nfsd_file\nreference from the delegation is never released. This potentially\ncauses open conflicts on that file.\n\nThen, on server shutdown, these leaks cause __nfsd_file_cache_purge()\nto encounter files with an elevated reference count that cannot be\ncleaned up, ultimately triggering a BUG() in kmem_cache_destroy()\nbecause there are still nfsd_file objects allocated in that cache.",
