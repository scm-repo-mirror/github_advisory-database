The external_oauth2_token middleware fails to sanitize incoming authentication headers before processing OAuth 2.0 tokens. By sending forged identity headers such as X-Is-Admin-Project, X-Roles, or X-User-Id, an authenticated attacker may escalate privileges or impersonate other users. All deployments using the external_oauth2_token middleware are affected.",
