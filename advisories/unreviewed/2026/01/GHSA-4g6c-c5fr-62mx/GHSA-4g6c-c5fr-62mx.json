  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/poll: correctly handle io_poll_add() return value on update\n\nWhen the core of io_uring was updated to handle completions\nconsistently and with fixed return codes, the POLL_REMOVE opcode\nwith updates got slightly broken. If a POLL_ADD is pending and\nthen POLL_REMOVE is used to update the events of that request, if that\nupdate causes the POLL_ADD to now trigger, then that completion is lost\nand a CQE is never posted.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that if an update does cause an existing POLL_ADD\nto complete, that the completion value isn't always overwritten with\n-ECANCELED. For that case, whatever io_poll_add() set the value to\nshould just be retained.",
