  "details": "A flaw was found in Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). Read-only scoped OAuth2 API Tokens in AAP, are enforced at the Gateway level for Gateway-specific operations. However, this vulnerability allows read-only tokens to perform write operations on backend services (e.g., Controller, Hub, EDA). If this flaw were exploited, an attacker‘s capabilities would only be limited by role based access controls (RBAC).",
