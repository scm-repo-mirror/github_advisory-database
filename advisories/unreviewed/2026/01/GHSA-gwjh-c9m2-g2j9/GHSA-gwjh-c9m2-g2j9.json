  ],
  "details": "The Bit Form – Contact Form Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized workflow execution due to missing authorization in the triggerWorkFlow function in all versions up to, and including, 2.21.6. This is due to a logic flaw in the nonce verification where the security check only blocks requests when both the nonce verification fails and the user is logged in. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to replay form workflow executions and trigger all configured integrations including webhooks, email notifications, CRM integrations, and automation platforms via the bitforms_trigger_workflow AJAX action granted they can obtain the entry ID and log IDs from a legitimate form submission response.",
