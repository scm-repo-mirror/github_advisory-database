  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlibceph: make decode_pool() more resilient against corrupted osdmaps\n\nIf the osdmap is (maliciously) corrupted such that the encoded length\nof ceph_pg_pool envelope is less than what is expected for a particular\nencoding version, out-of-bounds reads may ensue because the only bounds\ncheck that is there is based on that length value.\n\nThis patch adds explicit bounds checks for each field that is decoded\nor skipped.",
