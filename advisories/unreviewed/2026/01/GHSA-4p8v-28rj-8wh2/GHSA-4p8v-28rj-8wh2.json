  "details": "mcp-server-siri-shortcuts shortcutName Command Injection Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of mcp-server-siri-shortcuts. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the shortcutName parameter. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-27910.",
