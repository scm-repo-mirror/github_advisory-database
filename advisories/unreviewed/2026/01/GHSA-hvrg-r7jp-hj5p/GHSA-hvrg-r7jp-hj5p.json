  "details": "The Awesome Hotel Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to incorrect authorization in the room-single.php shortcode handler in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to the plugin relying solely on nonce verification without capability checks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify arbitrary booking records by obtaining a nonce from the public booking form.",
