  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nparisc: Do not reprogram affinitiy on ASP chip\n\nThe ASP chip is a very old variant of the GSP chip and is used e.g. in\nHP 730 workstations. When trying to reprogram the affinity it will crash\nwith a HPMC as the relevant registers don't seem to be at the usual\nlocation.  Let's avoid the crash by checking the sversion. Also note,\nthat reprogramming isn't necessary either, as the HP730 is a just a\nsingle-CPU machine.",
