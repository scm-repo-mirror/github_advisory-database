  ],
  "details": "The WP-Members Membership Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized file access in versions up to, and including, 3.5.4.4. This is due to storing user-uploaded files in predictable directories (wp-content/uploads/wpmembers/user_files/<user_id>/) without implementing proper access controls beyond basic directory listing protection (.htaccess with Options -Indexes). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to directly access and download sensitive documents uploaded by site users via direct URL access, granted they can guess or enumerate user IDs and filenames.",
