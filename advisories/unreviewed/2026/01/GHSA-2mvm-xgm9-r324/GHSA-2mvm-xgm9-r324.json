  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: zero non-PI portion of auto integrity buffer\n\nThe auto-generated integrity buffer for writes needs to be fully\ninitialized before being passed to the underlying block device,\notherwise the uninitialized memory can be read back by userspace or\nanyone with physical access to the storage device. If protection\ninformation is generated, that portion of the integrity buffer is\nalready initialized. The integrity data is also zeroed if PI generation\nis disabled via sysfs or the PI tuple size is 0. However, this misses\nthe case where PI is generated and the PI tuple size is nonzero, but the\nmetadata size is larger than the PI tuple. In this case, the remainder\n(\"opaque\") of the metadata is left uninitialized.\nGeneralize the BLK_INTEGRITY_CSUM_NONE check to cover any case when the\nmetadata is larger than just the PI tuple.",
