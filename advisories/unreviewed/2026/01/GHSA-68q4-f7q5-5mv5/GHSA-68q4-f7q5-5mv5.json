  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: btusb: revert use of devm_kzalloc in btusb\n\nThis reverts commit 98921dbd00c4e (\"Bluetooth: Use devm_kzalloc in\nbtusb.c file\").\n\nIn btusb_probe(), we use devm_kzalloc() to allocate the btusb data. This\nties the lifetime of all the btusb data to the binding of a driver to\none interface, INTF. In a driver that binds to other interfaces, ISOC\nand DIAG, this is an accident waiting to happen.\n\nThe issue is revealed in btusb_disconnect(), where calling\nusb_driver_release_interface(&btusb_driver, data->intf) will have devm\nfree the data that is also being used by the other interfaces of the\ndriver that may not be released yet.\n\nTo fix this, revert the use of devm and go back to freeing memory\nexplicitly.",
