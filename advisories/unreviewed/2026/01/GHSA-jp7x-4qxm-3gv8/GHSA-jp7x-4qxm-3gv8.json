  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkernel/kexec: fix IMA when allocation happens in CMA area\n\n*** Bug description ***\n\nWhen I tested kexec with the latest kernel, I ran into the following warning:\n\n[   40.712410] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[   40.712576] WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 1562 at kernel/kexec_core.c:1001 kimage_map_segment+0x144/0x198\n[...]\n[   40.816047] Call trace:\n[   40.818498]  kimage_map_segment+0x144/0x198 (P)\n[   40.823221]  ima_kexec_post_load+0x58/0xc0\n[   40.827246]  __do_sys_kexec_file_load+0x29c/0x368\n[...]\n[   40.855423] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n\n*** How to reproduce ***\n\nThis bug is only triggered when the kexec target address is allocated in\nthe CMA area. If no CMA area is reserved in the kernel, use the \"cma=\"\noption in the kernel command line to reserve one.\n\n*** Root cause ***\nThe commit 07d24902977e (\"kexec: enable CMA based contiguous\nallocation\") allocates the kexec target address directly on the CMA area\nto avoid copying during the jump. In this case, there is no IND_SOURCE\nfor the kexec segment.  But the current implementation of\nkimage_map_segment() assumes that IND_SOURCE pages exist and map them\ninto a contiguous virtual address by vmap().\n\n*** Solution ***\nIf IMA segment is allocated in the CMA area, use its page_address()\ndirectly.",
