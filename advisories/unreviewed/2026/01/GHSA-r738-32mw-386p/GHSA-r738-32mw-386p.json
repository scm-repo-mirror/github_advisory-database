  "details": "In the Eclipse Theia Website repository, the GitHub Actions workflow .github/workflows/preview.yml used pull_request_target trigger while checking out and executing untrusted pull request code. This allowed any GitHub user to execute arbitrary code in the repository's CI environment with access to repository secrets and a GITHUB_TOKEN with extensive write permissions (contents:write, packages:write, pages:write, actions:write). An attacker could exfiltrate secrets, publish malicious packages to the eclipse-theia organization, modify the official Theia website, and push malicious code to the repository.",
