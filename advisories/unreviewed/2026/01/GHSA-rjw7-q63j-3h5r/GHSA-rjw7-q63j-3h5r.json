  "details": "An authentication bypass vulnerability in the Tongyu AX1800 Wi-Fi 6 Router with firmware 1.0.0 allows unauthenticated network-adjacent attackers to perform arbitrary configuration changes without providing credentials, as long as a valid admin session is active. This can result in full compromise of the device (i.e., via unauthenticated access to /boaform/formSaveConfig and /boaform/admin endpoints).",
