  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\num: init cpu_tasks[] earlier\n\nThis is currently done in uml_finishsetup(), but e.g. with\nKCOV enabled we'll crash because some init code can call\ninto e.g. memparse(), which has coverage annotations, and\nthen the checks in check_kcov_mode() crash because current\nis NULL.\n\nSimply initialize the cpu_tasks[] array statically, which\nfixes the crash. For the later SMP work, it seems to have\nnot really caused any problems yet, but initialize all of\nthe entries anyway.",
