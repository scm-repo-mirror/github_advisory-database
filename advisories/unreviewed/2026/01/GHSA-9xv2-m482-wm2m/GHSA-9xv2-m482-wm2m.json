  "details": "An SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the GetServiceByRestaurantID endpoint of the Aptsys gemscms POS Platform backend thru 2025-05-28. The vulnerability arises because user input is directly inserted into a dynamic SQL query syntax without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary SQL code by submitting crafted input in the id parameter, leading to unauthorized data access or modification.",
