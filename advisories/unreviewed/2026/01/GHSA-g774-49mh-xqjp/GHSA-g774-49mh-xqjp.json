  "details": "This vulnerability arises because there are no limitations on the number\n of authentication attempts a user can make. An attacker can exploit \nthis weakness by continuously sending authentication requests, leading \nto a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This can overwhelm the \nauthentication system, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users and \npotentially causing service disruption. This can also allow attackers to\n conduct brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access.",
