  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nInput: lkkbd - disable pending work before freeing device\n\nlkkbd_interrupt() schedules lk->tq via schedule_work(), and the work\nhandler lkkbd_reinit() dereferences the lkkbd structure and its\nserio/input_dev fields.\n\nlkkbd_disconnect() and error paths in lkkbd_connect() free the lkkbd\nstructure without preventing the reinit work from being queued again\nuntil serio_close() returns. This can allow the work handler to run\nafter the structure has been freed, leading to a potential use-after-free.\n\nUse disable_work_sync() instead of cancel_work_sync() to ensure the\nreinit work cannot be re-queued, and call it both in lkkbd_disconnect()\nand in lkkbd_connect() error paths after serio_open().",
