  "details": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise (Packaged CCE) and Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (Unified CCE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device.&nbsp;\n\nThese vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.",
