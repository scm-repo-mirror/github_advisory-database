  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: correctly decode TTLM with default link map\n\nTID-To-Link Mapping (TTLM) elements do not contain any link mapping\npresence indicator if a default mapping is used and parsing needs to be\nskipped.\n\nNote that access points should not explicitly report an advertised TTLM\nwith a default mapping as that is the implied mapping if the element is\nnot included, this is even the case when switching back to the default\nmapping. However, mac80211 would incorrectly parse the frame and would\nalso read one byte beyond the end of the element.",
