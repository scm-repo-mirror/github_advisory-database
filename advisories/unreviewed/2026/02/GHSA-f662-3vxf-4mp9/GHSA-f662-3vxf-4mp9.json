  ],
  "details": "In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.13, an insufficient granularity of access control vulnerability allows users to delete prompts created in other organizations through ID manipulation. The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to validate the ownership of the prompt before deletion, only checking if the user has permissions to delete such resources without verifying if it belongs to the user's project or organization. As a result, users can remove prompts not owned by their organization or project, leading to legitimate users being unable to access the removed prompts and causing information inconsistencies.",
