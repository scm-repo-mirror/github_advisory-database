  "details": "A third-party NAT traversal module fails to validate SSL/TLS certificates when connecting to the signaling server. While subsequent access to device services requires additional authentication, a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker can intercept or redirect the NAT tunnel establishment. This could allow an attacker to disrupt service availability or facilitate further targeted attacks by acting as a proxy between the user and the device services.\nAffected products and versions include: from ADM 4.1.0 through ADM 4.3.3.ROF1 as well as from ADM 5.0.0 through ADM 5.1.1.RCI1.",
