  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: fix inverted genmask check in nft_map_catchall_activate()\n\nnft_map_catchall_activate() has an inverted element activity check\ncompared to its non-catchall counterpart nft_mapelem_activate() and\ncompared to what is logically required.\n\nnft_map_catchall_activate() is called from the abort path to re-activate\ncatchall map elements that were deactivated during a failed transaction.\nIt should skip elements that are already active (they don't need\nre-activation) and process elements that are inactive (they need to be\nrestored). Instead, the current code does the opposite: it skips inactive\nelements and processes active ones.\n\nCompare the non-catchall activate callback, which is correct:\n\n  nft_mapelem_activate():\n    if (nft_set_elem_active(ext, iter->genmask))\n        return 0;   /* skip active, process inactive */\n\nWith the buggy catchall version:\n\n  nft_map_catchall_activate():\n    if (!nft_set_elem_active(ext, genmask))\n        continue;   /* skip inactive, process active */\n\nThe consequence is that when a DELSET operation is aborted,\nnft_setelem_data_activate() is never called for the catchall element.\nFor NFT_GOTO verdict elements, this means nft_data_hold() is never\ncalled to restore the chain->use reference count. Each abort cycle\npermanently decrements chain->use. Once chain->use reaches zero,\nDELCHAIN succeeds and frees the chain while catchall verdict elements\nstill reference it, resulting in a use-after-free.\n\nThis is exploitable for local privilege escalation from an unprivileged\nuser via user namespaces + nftables on distributions that enable\nCONFIG_USER_NS and CONFIG_NF_TABLES.\n\nFix by removing the negation so the check matches nft_mapelem_activate():\nskip active elements, process inactive ones.",
