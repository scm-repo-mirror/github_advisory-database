  "details": "Axigen Mail Server before 10.5.57 allows stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the handling of the timeFormat account preference parameter. Attackers can exploit this by deploying a multi-stage attack. In the first stage, a malicious JavaScript payload is injected into the timeFormat preference by exploiting a separate vulnerability or using compromised credentials. In the second stage, when the victim logs into the WebMail interface, the unsanitized timeFormat value is loaded from storage and inserted into the DOM, causing the injected script to execute.",
