  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: tegra210-quad: Protect curr_xfer in tegra_qspi_combined_seq_xfer\n\nThe curr_xfer field is read by the IRQ handler without holding the lock\nto check if a transfer is in progress. When clearing curr_xfer in the\ncombined sequence transfer loop, protect it with the spinlock to prevent\na race with the interrupt handler.\n\nProtect the curr_xfer clearing at the exit path of\ntegra_qspi_combined_seq_xfer() with the spinlock to prevent a race\nwith the interrupt handler that reads this field.\n\nWithout this protection, the IRQ handler could read a partially updated\ncurr_xfer value, leading to NULL pointer dereference or use-after-free.",
