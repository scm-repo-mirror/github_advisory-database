  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: imx: preserve error state in block data length handler\n\nWhen a block read returns an invalid length, zero or >I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX,\nthe length handler sets the state to IMX_I2C_STATE_FAILED. However,\ni2c_imx_master_isr() unconditionally overwrites this with\nIMX_I2C_STATE_READ_CONTINUE, causing an endless read loop that overruns\nbuffers and crashes the system.\n\nGuard the state transition to preserve error states set by the length\nhandler.",
