  "details": "Due to an uncontrolled resource consumption (Denial of Service) vulnerability, an authenticated attacker with regular user privileges and network access can repeatedly invoke a remote-enabled function module with an excessively large loop-control parameter. This triggers prolonged loop execution that consumes excessive system resources, potentially rendering the system unavailable. Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition that impacts availability, while confidentiality and integrity remain unaffected.",
