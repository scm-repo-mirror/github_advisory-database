  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: add missing ice_deinit_hw() in devlink reinit path\n\ndevlink-reload results in ice_init_hw failed error, and then removing\nthe ice driver causes a NULL pointer dereference.\n\n[  +0.102213] ice 0000:ca:00.0: ice_init_hw failed: -16\n...\n[  +0.000001] Call Trace:\n[  +0.000003]  <TASK>\n[  +0.000006]  ice_unload+0x8f/0x100 [ice]\n[  +0.000081]  ice_remove+0xba/0x300 [ice]\n\nCommit 1390b8b3d2be (\"ice: remove duplicate call to ice_deinit_hw() on\nerror paths\") removed ice_deinit_hw() from ice_deinit_dev(). As a result\nice_devlink_reinit_down() no longer calls ice_deinit_hw(), but\nice_devlink_reinit_up() still calls ice_init_hw(). Since the control\nqueues are not uninitialized, ice_init_hw() fails with -EBUSY.\n\nAdd ice_deinit_hw() to ice_devlink_reinit_down() to correspond with\nice_init_hw() in ice_devlink_reinit_up().",
