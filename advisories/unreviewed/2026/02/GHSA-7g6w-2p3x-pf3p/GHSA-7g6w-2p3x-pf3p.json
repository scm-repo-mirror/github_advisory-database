  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: ems_usb: ems_usb_read_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak\n\nFix similar memory leak as in commit 7352e1d5932a (\"can: gs_usb:\ngs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak\").\n\nIn ems_usb_open(), the URBs for USB-in transfers are allocated, added to\nthe dev->rx_submitted anchor and submitted. In the complete callback\nems_usb_read_bulk_callback(), the URBs are processed and resubmitted. In\nems_usb_close() the URBs are freed by calling\nusb_kill_anchored_urbs(&dev->rx_submitted).\n\nHowever, this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors\nthe URB before the complete function is called. This means that once an\nin-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not\nreleased in ems_usb_close().\n\nFix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the\nems_usb_read_bulk_callback() to the dev->rx_submitted anchor.",
