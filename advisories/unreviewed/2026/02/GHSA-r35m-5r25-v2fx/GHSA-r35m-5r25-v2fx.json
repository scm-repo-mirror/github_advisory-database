  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nceph: fix NULL pointer dereference in ceph_mds_auth_match()\n\nThe CephFS kernel client has regression starting from 6.18-rc1.\nWe have issue in ceph_mds_auth_match() if fs_name == NULL:\n\n    const char fs_name = mdsc->fsc->mount_options->mds_namespace;\n    ...\n    if (auth->match.fs_name && strcmp(auth->match.fs_name, fs_name)) {\n            / fsname mismatch, try next one */\n            return 0;\n    }\n\nPatrick Donnelly suggested that: In summary, we should definitely start\ndecoding `fs_name` from the MDSMap and do strict authorizations checks\nagainst it. Note that the `-o mds_namespace=foo` should only be used for\nselecting the file system to mount and nothing else. It's possible\nno mds_namespace is specified but the kernel will mount the only\nfile system that exists which may have name \"foo\".\n\nThis patch reworks ceph_mdsmap_decode() and namespace_equals() with\nthe goal of supporting the suggested concept. Now struct ceph_mdsmap\ncontains m_fs_name field that receives copy of extracted FS name\nby ceph_extract_encoded_string(). For the case of \"old\" CephFS file\nsystems, it is used \"cephfs\" name.\n\n[ idryomov: replace redundant %*pE with %s in ceph_mdsmap_decode(),\n  get rid of a series of strlen() calls in ceph_namespace_match(),\n  drop changes to namespace_equals() body to avoid treating empty\n  mds_namespace as equal, drop changes to ceph_mdsc_handle_fsmap()\n  as namespace_equals() isn't an equivalent substitution there ]",
