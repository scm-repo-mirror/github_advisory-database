  "details": "The Popup builder with Gamification, Multi-Step Popups, Page-Level Targeting, and WooCommerce Triggers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the multiple REST API endpoints in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\nVulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 for unauthenticated users, and fully patched in version 2.2.3 for Administrator+ level users.",
