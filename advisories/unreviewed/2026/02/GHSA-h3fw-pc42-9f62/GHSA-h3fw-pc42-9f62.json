  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: zlib: fix the folio leak on S390 hardware acceleration\n\n[BUG]\nAfter commit aa60fe12b4f4 (\"btrfs: zlib: refactor S390x HW acceleration\nbuffer preparation\"), we no longer release the folio of the page cache\nof folio returned by btrfs_compress_filemap_get_folio() for S390\nhardware acceleration path.\n\n[CAUSE]\nBefore that commit, we call kumap_local() and folio_put() after handling\neach folio.\n\nAlthough the timing is not ideal (it release previous folio at the\nbeginning of the loop, and rely on some extra cleanup out of the loop),\nit at least handles the folio release correctly.\n\nMeanwhile the refactored code is easier to read, it lacks the call to\nrelease the filemap folio.\n\n[FIX]\nAdd the missing folio_put() for copy_data_into_buffer().",
