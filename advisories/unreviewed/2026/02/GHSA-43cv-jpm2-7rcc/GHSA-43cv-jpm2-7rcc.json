  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuacce: implement mremap in uacce_vm_ops to return -EPERM\n\nThe current uacce_vm_ops does not support the mremap operation of\nvm_operations_struct. Implement .mremap to return -EPERM to remind\nusers.\n\nThe reason we need to explicitly disable mremap is that when the\ndriver does not implement .mremap, it uses the default mremap\nmethod. This could lead to a risk scenario:\n\nAn application might first mmap address p1, then mremap to p2,\nfollowed by munmap(p1), and finally munmap(p2). Since the default\nmremap copies the original vma's vm_private_data (i.e., q) to the\nnew vma, both munmap operations would trigger vma_close, causing\nq->qfr to be freed twice(qfr will be set to null here, so repeated\nrelease is ok).",
