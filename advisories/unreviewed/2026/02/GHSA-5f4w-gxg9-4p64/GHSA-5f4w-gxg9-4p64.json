  ],
  "details": "A security flaw was identified in the Ansible Lightspeed API conversation endpoints that handle AI chat interactions. The APIs do not properly verify whether a conversation identifier belongs to the authenticated user making the request. As a result, an attacker with valid credentials could access or influence conversations owned by other users. This exposes sensitive conversation data and allows unauthorized manipulation of AI-generated outputs.",
