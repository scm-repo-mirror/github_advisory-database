  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf: Fix refcount warning on event->mmap_count increment\n\nWhen calling refcount_inc(&event->mmap_count) inside perf_mmap_rb(), the\nfollowing warning is triggered:\n\n        refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.\n        WARNING: lib/refcount.c:25\n\nPoC:\n\n    struct perf_event_attr attr = {0};\n    int fd = syscall(__NR_perf_event_open, &attr, 0, -1, -1, 0);\n    mmap(NULL, 0x3000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);\n    int victim = syscall(__NR_perf_event_open, &attr, 0, -1, fd,\n                         PERF_FLAG_FD_OUTPUT);\n    mmap(NULL, 0x3000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, victim, 0);\n\nThis occurs when creating a group member event with the flag\nPERF_FLAG_FD_OUTPUT. The group leader should be mmap-ed and then mmap-ing\nthe event triggers the warning.\n\nSince the event has copied the output_event in perf_event_set_output(),\nevent->rb is set. As a result, perf_mmap_rb() calls\nrefcount_inc(&event->mmap_count) when event->mmap_count = 0.\n\nDisallow the case when event->mmap_count = 0. This also prevents two\nevents from updating the same user_page.",
