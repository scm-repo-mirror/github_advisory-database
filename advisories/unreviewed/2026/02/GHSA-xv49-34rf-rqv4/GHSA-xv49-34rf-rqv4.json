  ],
  "details": "A flaw was found in libsoup, an HTTP client/server library. This HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerability arises from non-RFC-compliant parsing in the soup_filter_input_stream_read_line() logic, where libsoup accepts malformed chunk headers, such as lone line feed (LF) characters instead of the required carriage return and line feed (CRLF). A remote attacker can exploit this without authentication or user interaction by sending specially crafted chunked requests. This allows libsoup to parse and process multiple HTTP requests from a single network message, potentially leading to information disclosure.",
