  "details": "A flaw was identified in libsoup, a widely used HTTP library in GNOME-based systems. When processing specially crafted HTTP Range headers, the library may improperly validate requested byte ranges. In certain build configurations, this could allow a remote attacker to access portions of server memory beyond the intended response. Exploitation requires a vulnerable configuration and access to a server using the embedded SoupServer component.",
