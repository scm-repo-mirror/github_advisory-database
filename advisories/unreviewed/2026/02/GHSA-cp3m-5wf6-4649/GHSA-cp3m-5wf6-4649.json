  "details": "METIS WIC devices (versions <= oscore 2.1.234-r18) expose a web-based shell at the /console endpoint that does not require authentication. Accessing this endpoint allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands with root (UID 0) privileges. This results in full system compromise, allowing unauthorized access to modify system configuration, read sensitive data, or disrupt device operations",
