  "details": "A flaw was found in libsoup. This stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability occurs during the parsing of multipart HTTP responses due to an incorrect length calculation. A remote attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted multipart HTTP response, which can lead to memory corruption. This issue may result in application crashes or arbitrary code execution in applications that process untrusted server responses, and it does not require authentication or user interaction.",
