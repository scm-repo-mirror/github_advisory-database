  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nregmap: Fix race condition in hwspinlock irqsave routine\n\nPreviously, the address of the shared member '&map->spinlock_flags' was\npassed directly to 'hwspin_lock_timeout_irqsave'. This creates a race\ncondition where multiple contexts contending for the lock could overwrite\nthe shared flags variable, potentially corrupting the state for the\ncurrent lock owner.\n\nFix this by using a local stack variable 'flags' to store the IRQ state\ntemporarily.",
