  "details": "The Accordion and Accordion Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.5. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the 'wp_aas_save_attachment_data' and 'wp_aas_get_attachment_edit_form' functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor level access and above, to read and modify attachment metadata including file paths, titles, captions, alt text, and custom links for any attachment on the site.",
