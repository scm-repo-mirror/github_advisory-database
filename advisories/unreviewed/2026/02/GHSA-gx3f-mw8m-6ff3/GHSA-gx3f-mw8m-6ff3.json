When called on an\nauxiliary timekeeper, the core timekeeper would be updated incorrectly.\n\nThis gets caught by the lock debugging diagnostics because the\ntimekeepers sequence lock gets written to without holding its\nassociated spinlock:\n\nWARNING: include/linux/seqlock.h:226 at __do_adjtimex+0x394/0x3b0, CPU#2: test/125\naux_clock_adj (kernel/time/timekeeping.c:2979)\n__do_sys_clock_adjtime (kernel/time/posix-timers.c:1161 kernel/time/posix-timers.c:1173)\ndo_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 (discriminator 1) arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94 (discriminator 1))\nentry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:131)\n\nUpdate the correct auxiliary timekeeper.",
