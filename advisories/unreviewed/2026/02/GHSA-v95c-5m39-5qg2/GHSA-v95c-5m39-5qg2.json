  "details": "The Tutor LMS – eLearning and online course solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.5. This is due to missing authorization checks in the `ajax_coupon_details()` function, which only validates nonces but does not verify user capabilities. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve sensitive coupon information including coupon codes, discount amounts, usage statistics, and course/bundle applications.",
