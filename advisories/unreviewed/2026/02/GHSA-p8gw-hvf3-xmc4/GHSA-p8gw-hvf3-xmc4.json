  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrxrpc: Fix data-race warning and potential load/store tearing\n\nFix the following:\n\n        BUG: KCSAN: data-race in rxrpc_peer_keepalive_worker / rxrpc_send_data_packet\n\nwhich is reporting an issue with the reads and writes to ->last_tx_at in:\n\n        conn->peer->last_tx_at = ktime_get_seconds();\n\nand:\n\n        keepalive_at = peer->last_tx_at + RXRPC_KEEPALIVE_TIME;\n\nThe lockless accesses to these to values aren't actually a problem as the\nread only needs an approximate time of last transmission for the purposes\nof deciding whether or not the transmission of a keepalive packet is\nwarranted yet.\n\nAlso, as ->last_tx_at is a 64-bit value, tearing can occur on a 32-bit\narch.\n\nFix both of these by switching to an unsigned int for ->last_tx_at and only\nstoring the LSW of the time64_t.  It can then be reconstructed at need\nprovided no more than 68 years has elapsed since the last transmission.",
