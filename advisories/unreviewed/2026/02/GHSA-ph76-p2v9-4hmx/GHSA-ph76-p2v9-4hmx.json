  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: fix iio_chan_spec for sensors without event detection\n\nThe st_lsm6dsx_acc_channels array of struct iio_chan_spec has a non-NULL\nevent_spec field, indicating support for IIO events. However, event\ndetection is not supported for all sensors, and if userspace tries to\nconfigure accelerometer wakeup events on a sensor device that does not\nsupport them (e.g. LSM6DS0), st_lsm6dsx_write_event() dereferences a NULL\npointer when trying to write to the wakeup register.\nDefine an additional struct iio_chan_spec array whose members have a NULL\nevent_spec field, and use this array instead of st_lsm6dsx_acc_channels for\nsensors without event detection capability.",
