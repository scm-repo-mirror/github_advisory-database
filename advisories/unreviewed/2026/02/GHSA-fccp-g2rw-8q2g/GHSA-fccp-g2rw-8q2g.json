  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: target: iscsi: Fix use-after-free in iscsit_dec_session_usage_count()\n\nIn iscsit_dec_session_usage_count(), the function calls complete() while\nholding the sess->session_usage_lock. Similar to the connection usage count\nlogic, the waiter signaled by complete() (e.g., in the session release\npath) may wake up and free the iscsit_session structure immediately.\n\nThis creates a race condition where the current thread may attempt to\nexecute spin_unlock_bh() on a session structure that has already been\ndeallocated, resulting in a KASAN slab-use-after-free.\n\nTo resolve this, release the session_usage_lock before calling complete()\nto ensure all dereferences of the sess pointer are finished before the\nwaiter is allowed to proceed with deallocation.",
