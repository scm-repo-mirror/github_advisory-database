  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncgroup/dmem: avoid pool UAF\n\nAn UAF issue was observed:\n\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in page_counter_uncharge+0x65/0x150\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffff888106715440 by task insmod/527\n\nCPU: 4 UID: 0 PID: 527 Comm: insmod    6.19.0-rc7-next-20260129+ #11\nTainted: [O]=OOT_MODULE\nCall Trace:\n<TASK>\ndump_stack_lvl+0x82/0xd0\nkasan_report+0xca/0x100\nkasan_check_range+0x39/0x1c0\npage_counter_uncharge+0x65/0x150\ndmem_cgroup_uncharge+0x1f/0x260\n\nAllocated by task 527:\n\nFreed by task 0:\n\nThe buggy address belongs to the object at ffff888106715400\nwhich belongs to the cache kmalloc-512 of size 512\nThe buggy address is located 64 bytes inside of\nfreed 512-byte region [ffff888106715400, ffff888106715600)\n\nThe buggy address belongs to the physical page:\n\nMemory state around the buggy address:\nffff888106715300: fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc\nffff888106715380: fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc\n>ffff888106715400: fa fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb\n\t\t\t\t     ^\nffff888106715480: fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb\nffff888106715500: fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb\n\nThe issue occurs because a pool can still be held by a caller after its\nassociated memory region is unregistered. The current implementation frees\nthe pool even if users still hold references to it (e.g., before uncharge\noperations complete).\n\nThis patch adds a reference counter to each pool, ensuring that a pool is\nonly freed when its reference count drops to zero.",
