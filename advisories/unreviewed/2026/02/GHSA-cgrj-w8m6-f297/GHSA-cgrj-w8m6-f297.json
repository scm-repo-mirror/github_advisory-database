  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrust_binder: correctly handle FDA objects of length zero\n\nFix a bug where an empty FDA (fd array) object with 0 fds would cause an\nout-of-bounds error. The previous implementation used `skip == 0` to\nmean \"this is a pointer fixup\", but 0 is also the correct skip length\nfor an empty FDA. If the FDA is at the end of the buffer, then this\nresults in an attempt to write 8-bytes out of bounds. This is caught and\nresults in an EINVAL error being returned to userspace.\n\nThe pattern of using `skip == 0` as a special value originates from the\nC-implementation of Binder. As part of fixing this bug, this pattern is\nreplaced with a Rust enum.\n\nI considered the alternate option of not pushing a fixup when the length\nis zero, but I think it's cleaner to just get rid of the zero-is-special\nstuff.\n\nThe root cause of this bug was diagnosed by Gemini CLI on first try. I\nused the following prompt:\n\n> There appears to be a bug in @drivers/android/binder/thread.rs where\n> the Fixups oob bug is triggered with 316 304 316 324. This implies\n> that we somehow ended up with a fixup where buffer A has a pointer to\n> buffer B, but the pointer is located at an index in buffer A that is\n> out of bounds. Please investigate the code to find the bug. You may\n> compare with @drivers/android/binder.c that implements this correctly.",
