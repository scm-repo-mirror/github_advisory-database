  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuacce: ensure safe queue release with state management\n\nDirectly calling `put_queue` carries risks since it cannot\nguarantee that resources of `uacce_queue` have been fully released\nbeforehand. So adding a `stop_queue` operation for the\nUACCE_CMD_PUT_Q command and leaving the `put_queue` operation to\nthe final resource release ensures safety.\n\nQueue states are defined as follows:\n- UACCE_Q_ZOMBIE: Initial state\n- UACCE_Q_INIT: After opening `uacce`\n- UACCE_Q_STARTED: After `start` is issued via `ioctl`\n\nWhen executing `poweroff -f` in virt while accelerator are still\nworking, `uacce_fops_release` and `uacce_remove` may execute\nconcurrently. This can cause `uacce_put_queue` within\n`uacce_fops_release` to access a NULL `ops` pointer. Therefore, add\nstate checks to prevent accessing freed pointers.",
