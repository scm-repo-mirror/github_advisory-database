  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-audio: Prevent excessive number of frames\n\nIn this case, the user constructed the parameters with maxpacksize 40\nfor rate 22050 / pps 1000, and packsize[0] 22 packsize[1] 23. The buffer\nsize for each data URB is maxpacksize * packets, which in this example\nis 40 * 6 = 240; When the user performs a write operation to send audio\ndata into the ALSA PCM playback stream, the calculated number of frames\nis packsize[0] * packets = 264, which exceeds the allocated URB buffer\nsize, triggering the out-of-bounds (OOB) issue reported by syzbot [1].\n\nAdded a check for the number of single data URB frames when calculating\nthe number of frames to prevent [1].\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in copy_to_urb+0x261/0x460 sound/usb/pcm.c:1487\nWrite of size 264 at addr ffff88804337e800 by task syz.0.17/5506\nCall Trace:\n copy_to_urb+0x261/0x460 sound/usb/pcm.c:1487\n prepare_playback_urb+0x953/0x13d0 sound/usb/pcm.c:1611\n prepare_outbound_urb+0x377/0xc50 sound/usb/endpoint.c:333",
