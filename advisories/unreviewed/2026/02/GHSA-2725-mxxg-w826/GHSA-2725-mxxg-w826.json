  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock/virtio: Coalesce only linear skb\n\nvsock/virtio common tries to coalesce buffers in rx queue: if a linear skb\n(with a spare tail room) is followed by a small skb (length limited by\nGOOD_COPY_LEN = 128), an attempt is made to join them.\n\nSince the introduction of MSG_ZEROCOPY support, assumption that a small skb\nwill always be linear is incorrect. In the zerocopy case, data is lost and\nthe linear skb is appended with uninitialized kernel memory.\n\nOf all 3 supported virtio-based transports, only loopback-transport is\naffected. G2H virtio-transport rx queue operates on explicitly linear skbs;\nsee virtio_vsock_alloc_linear_skb() in virtio_vsock_rx_fill(). H2G\nvhost-transport may allocate non-linear skbs, but only for sizes that are\nnot considered for coalescence; see PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER in\nvirtio_vsock_alloc_skb().\n\nEnsure only linear skbs are coalesced. Note that skb_tailroom(last_skb) > 0\nguarantees last_skb is linear.",
