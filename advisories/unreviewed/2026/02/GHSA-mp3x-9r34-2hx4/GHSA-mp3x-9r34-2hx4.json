  "details": "A vulnerability in the text rendering subsystem of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\n\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of input received by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by getting the affected device to render crafted text, for example, a crafted meeting invitation. As indicated in the CVSS score, no user interaction is required, such as accepting the meeting invitation. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
