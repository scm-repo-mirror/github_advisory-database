  "summary": "This vulnerability is actually fixed from Python ~3.12.9, and Python ^3.13.2",
  "details": "Starting in Python 3.12.0, the asyncio._SelectorSocketTransport.writelines()\n method would not \"pause\" writing and signal to the Protocol to drain \nthe buffer to the wire once the write buffer reached the \"high-water \nmark\". Because of this, Protocols would not periodically drain the write\n buffer potentially leading to memory exhaustion.\n\nThis vulnerability likely impacts a small number of users, you must be using\n Python 3.12.0 or later, on macOS or Linux, using the asyncio module \nwith protocols, and using .writelines() method which had new \nzero-copy-on-write behavior in Python 3.12.0 and later. If not all of \nthese factors are true then your usage of Python is unaffected.\n\nThis vulnerabilty is fixed in Python ~3.12.9, and Python ^3.13.2 according to:\nhttps://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127655 (which were effectively released in the mentioned versions and will be included in the upcoming Python 3.14.0 release)\n",
