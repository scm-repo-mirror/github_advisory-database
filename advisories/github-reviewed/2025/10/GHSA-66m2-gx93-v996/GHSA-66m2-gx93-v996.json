  "summary": "Claude Code permission deny bypass through symlink",
  "details": "Claude Code failed to account for symlinks when checking permission deny rules. If a user explicitly denied Claude Code access to a file and Claude Code had access to a symlink pointing to that file, it was possible for Claude Code to access the file. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nThank you to https://hackerone.com/vinai for reporting this issue!",
