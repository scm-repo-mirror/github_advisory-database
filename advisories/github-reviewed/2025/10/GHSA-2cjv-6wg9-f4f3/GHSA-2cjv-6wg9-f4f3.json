  "summary": "Strapi Password Hashing is Missing Maximum Password Length Validation",
  "details": "## Summary\n\nStrapi's password hashing implementation using bcryptjs lacks maximum password length validation. Since bcryptjs truncates passwords exceeding 72 bytes, this creates potential vulnerabilities such as authentication bypass and performance degradation.\n\n## POC\nCreate an admin user with a password exceeding 72 characters like 85,\nLog in using only the first 72 characters of the password.\nAuthentication is successful, confirming the issue.\n\nProposed Solution Based on  discussions:\n\nAdd a maximum password length validation (72 characters) during password creation and updates for both Admin and U&P users.\nTruncate passwords exceeding 72 bytes on the server before passing them to bcryptjs during login.\nOptionally, issue a warning to users with passwords longer than 72 bytes during login, informing them of truncation.\n\n## Impact\nThis issue affects all Strapi installations using bcryptjs for password hashing. Until resolved, it can lead to:\nAuthentication Bypass: Users may unknowingly set passwords exceeding 72 bytes, leading to truncated, predictable hashes.\nPerformance Issues: Excessively long passwords can degrade server performance.",
