  "summary": "bagisto has Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Create New Customer",
  "details": "### Summary\nIn Bagisto v2.3.7, the “Create New Customer” feature (in the admin panel) is vulnerable to reflected / stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker with access to the admin create-customer form can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into certain input fields. These payloads may later execute in the context of an admin’s browser or another user viewing the customer data, enabling session theft or admin-level actions.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability arises because certain input fields are not properly sanitized or escaped when rendering customer data in the admin UI. The form data is stored in the database (i.e. it is stored XSS), and later when customer records are displayed (e.g. in a grid, detail view, or listing), the input is interpolated into HTML without encoding or filtering. \n\n### PoC\nNavigate to sales orders, and create a new customer.\n<img width=\"643\" height=\"567\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3a7c5a2-f53b-4db6-ac23-3451bca58956\" />\nEnter the payload `\"><svg/onload=prompt(document.domain)>` to the first_name and last_name.\n<img width=\"1527\" height=\"767\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86ac325e-7700-477d-a13d-be2d4885f510\" />\nScripts were triggered.\n<img width=\"1267\" height=\"321\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce673b44-13cc-4e88-a89e-03bf0bd7e244\" />\n<img width=\"1336\" height=\"404\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d45913ea-b177-4926-8612-92518e12f11e\" />\n\n\n### Impact\nStored XSS vulnerability — malicious script persisted in database and executed when viewing the data. An attacker (with limited privilege) could inject JavaScript that runs in the browser of an admin or user who views injected customer records. The script can steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of admin, escalate privileges, or pivot into further attacks. In an e-commerce admin system, this is high severity due to potential access to customer data, order management, or site configuration.",
