  "summary": "containerd CRI server: Host memory exhaustion through Attach goroutine leak",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nA bug was found in containerd's CRI Attach implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host due to goroutine leaks. \n\nRepetitive calls of CRI Attach (e.g., [`kubectl attach`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_attach/)) could increase the memory usage of containerd.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been fixed in the following containerd versions:\n\n* 2.2.0\n* 2.1.5\n* 2.0.7\n* 1.7.29\n\nUsers should update to these versions to resolve the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSet up an admission controller to control accesses to `pods/attach` resources.\ne.g., [Validating Admission Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/).\n\n### Credits\n\nThe containerd project would like to thank @Wheat2018 for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/SECURITY.md).\n\n### References\n\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-64329\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)\n\nTo report a security issue in containerd:\n\n* [Report a new vulnerability](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/new)",
