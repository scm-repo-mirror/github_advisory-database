  "summary": "@dependencytrack/frontend vulnerable to Persistent Cross-Site-Scripting via welcome message",
  "details": "### Description\n\nSince version 4.12.0, Dependency-Track users with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission can configure a \"welcome message\", which is HTML that is to be rendered on the login page for branding purposes.\n\nWhen rendering the welcome message, Dependency-Track versions before 4.13.6 did not properly sanitize the HTML, allowing arbitrary JavaScript to be executed.\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission (i.e., administrators), can exploit this weakness to execute arbitrary JavaScript for users browsing to the login page. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed in version 4.13.6.\n\n### References\n\n* The issue was introduced via: https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend/pull/986\n* The issue was fixed via: https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend/pull/1378\n\n### Credit\n\nThanks to *Jonas Benjamin Friedli* for identifying and responsibly disclosing the issue.",
