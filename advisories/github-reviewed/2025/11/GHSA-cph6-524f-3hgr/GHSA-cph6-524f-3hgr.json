  "summary": "Directus Vulnerable to Information Leakage in Existing Collections",
  "details": "### Summary:\n\nAn observable difference in error messaging was found in the Directus REST API. The `/items/{collection}` API returns different error messages for these two cases:\n1. A user tries to access an existing collection which they are not authorized to access.\n2. A user tries to access a non-existing collection.\n\nThe two differing error messages leak the existence of collections to users which are not authorized to access these collections.\n\n### Details:\n\nThe following response returns an error message, when requesting a collection the user is not authorized to access.\n\n```\nGET /items/no-access\n{\n  \"errors\": [\n    {\n      \"message\": \"You don't have permission to access collection \\\"no-access\\\" or it does not exist. Queried in root.\",\n      \"extensions\": {\n        \"reason\": \"You don't have permission to access collection \\\"no-access\\\" or it does not exist. Queried in root.\",\n        \"code\": \"FORBIDDEN\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe following response returns a different error message when requesting a collection which does not exist.\n\n```\nGET /items/does-not-exist\n{\n  \"errors\": [\n    {\n      \"message\": \"You don't have permission to access this.\",\n      \"extensions\": {\n        \"code\": \"FORBIDDEN\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Impact:\n\nThe difference in errors between non-existent collections and collections blocked by permissions leak the existence of a collection to a user which is not authorized to access this object.\n\n### Credit:\n\nSebastian Krause - [Hackmanit GmbH](https://hackmanit.de)",
