  "summary": "Incus vulnerable to local privilege escalation through custom storage volumes",
  "details": "### Impact\nThis affects any Incus user in an environment where an unprivileged user may have root access to a container with an attached custom storage volume that has the `security.shifted` property set to `true` as well as access to the host as an unprivileged user.\n\nThe most common case for this would be systems using `incus-user` with the less privileged `incus` group to provide unprivileged users with an isolated restricted access to Incus. Such users may be able to create a custom storage volume with the necessary property (depending on kernel and filesystem support) and can then write a setuid binary from within the container which can be executed as an unpriivleged user on the host to gain root privileges.\n\n### Patches\nA patch for this issue is available here: https://github.com/lxc/incus/pull/2642\n\nThe first commit changes the permissions for any new storage pool, the second commit applies it on startup to all existing storage pools.\n\n### Workarounds\nPermissions can be manually restricted until a patched version of Incus is deployed.\n\nThis is done with:\n\n```\nchmod 0700 /var/lib/incus/storage-pools/*/*\nchmod 0711 /var/lib/incus/storage-pools/*/buckets*\nchmod 0711 /var/lib/incus/storage-pools/*/container*\n```\n\nThose are the same permissions which will be applied by the patched Incus for both new and existing storage pools.\n\n### References\nThis was reported publicly on Github: https://github.com/lxc/incus/issues/2641",
