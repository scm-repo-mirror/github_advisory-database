  "summary": "Template Secret leakage in logs in Scaffolder when using `fetch:template`",
  "details": "A logging flaw in Backstage Scaffolder’s `fetch:template` action up to `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend` **2.1.0** may write template secrets to logs. The action emitted a duplicate, pre-redaction copy of input parameters, so values provided via the `{{ secrets }}` bag could appear in local/server logs when the action ran. Exploitation requires use of the `secrets` argument and access to Scaffolder/build logs; integrity and availability are unaffected.\n\n*   **Fix:** upgrade to `2.1.1`, which removes the duplicate log path and ensures secrets are redacted.\n*   **Mitigation:** avoid passing `{{ secrets }}` to `fetch:template` if upgrade is not possible.\n\n> Open an issue in the [Backstage repository](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)\n>\n> Visit our Discord, linked to in [Backstage README](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)",
