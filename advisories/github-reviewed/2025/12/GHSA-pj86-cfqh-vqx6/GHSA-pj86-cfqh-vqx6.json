  "details": "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it describes a correctness bug, not a vulnerability with real security impact. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\n### Impact\n\nwhen using the extended query parser in express (`'query parser': 'extended'`), the `request.query` object inherits all object prototype properties, but these properties can be overwritten by query string parameter keys that match the property names\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> the extended query parser is the default in express 4; this was changed in express 5 which by default uses the simple query parser\n\n### Patches\n\nthe issue has been patched to ensure `request.query` is a plain object so `request.query` no longer has object prototype properties. this brings the default behavior of extended query parsing in line with express's default simple query parser\n\n### Workaround\n\nthis only impacts users using extended query parsing (`'query parser': 'extended'`), which is the default in express 4, but not express 5.  all users are encouraged to upgrade to the patched versions, but can otherwise work around this issue:\n\n#### provide `qs` directly and specify `plainObjects: true`\n\n```js\napp.set('query parser',\n  function (str) {\n    return qs.parse(str, {\n      plainObjects: true\n  });\n});\n```",
