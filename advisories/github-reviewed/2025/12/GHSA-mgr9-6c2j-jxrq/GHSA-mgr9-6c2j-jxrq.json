  "summary": "Pterodactyl has a Reflected XSS vulnerability in “Create New Database Host”",
  "details": "> [!NOTE]\n> Message from the Pterodactyl team:\n>\n> The Pterodactyl team has evaluated this as a minor security issue but does not consider it something that should be assigned a CVE, nor does it require active patching by vulnerable systems.\n>\n> This issue is entirely self-inflicted and requires an administrative user paste an _obviously_ incorrect value into a database host field, submit it, and run into the XSS when the error message is rendered. However, we have determined that this fix is good security hygiene and may prevent issues in other areas not yet discovered.\n\n### Summary\nWhen an administrative user creates a new database host they are prompted to provide a `Host` value which is expected to be a domain or IP address. When an invalid value is encountered and passed back to `gethostaddr` and/or directly to the MySQL connection tooling, an error is returned. This error is then passed back along to the front-end, but was not properly sanitized when rendered.\n\nTherefore it is possible for an admin to _knowingly_ paste a malicious payload such as `<script>prompt(document.domain)</script>` into the `Host` field and XSS themselves.",
