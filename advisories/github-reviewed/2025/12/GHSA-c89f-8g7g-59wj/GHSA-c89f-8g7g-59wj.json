The alert rule name is not properly sanitized, and can be used to inject HTML code.\n\n# Affected versions\nThe latest version at the time of writing (25.10.0) is vulnerable.\n\n# Root cause\nWhen an alert rule is created or updated via the API, function `add_edit_rule()` in `includes/html/api_functions.inc.php` is called to add/update the entry in the database. When an alert rule is created via the web interface, HTML tags are stripped from the rule name, however this is not the case when using the API.\n\nAs such, it is possible to create an alert rule where the name is:\n```\n<script>alert(1)</script>\n```\n\nLater, when a victim browses to the Alerts > Alert Rule page, PHP script\\xc2\\xa0`includes/html/print-alert/rules.php`\\xc2\\xa0is called. It notably includes the file\\xc2\\xa0`includes/html/modal/alert_rule_list.inc.php`, which returns HTML code for a modal window that searches alert rules.\n\nThe modal window includes an HTML table with all rules, including their name, and an inline JavaScript that calls the\\xc2\\xa0`bootgrid()`\\xc2\\xa0function ([http://www.jquery-bootgrid.com/](http://www.jquery-bootgrid.com/)) for styling and enhancing the table.\n\n`alert_rule.list.inc.php` sanitizes the rule name with the function `e()` before including it in the table, which XML encodes all special characters. However the\\xc2\\xa0`bootgrid()`\\xc2\\xa0function rewrites the table cells content when enhancing the table, and as a side effect, XML character references are decoded. After the script updated the table, the browser now interprets the payload as HTML tags and includes the code to the DOM.\n\n# Detection guidance\n- inspect HTTP POST and PUT requests to a Request-URI that includes the string\\xc2\\xa0`/api/v0/rules`\n- check if the\\xc2\\xa0`name`\\xc2\\xa0JSON value includes a `<` character\n\n# PoC\nThe proof-of-concept can be run as such:\n```\npython3 poc.py ip_addr -T <token>\n```\n\n\n-- CREDIT ---------------------------------------\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\nSimon Humbert of Trend Research of Trend Micro\n\n-- FURTHER DETAILS ------------------------------\n\nSupporting files:\n\n\nIf supporting files were contained with this report they are provided within a password protected ZIP file. The password is the ZDI candidate number in the form: ZDI-CAN-XXXX where XXXX is the ID number.\n\nPlease confirm receipt of this report. We expect all vendors to remediate ZDI vulnerabilities within 120 days of the reported date. If you are ready to release a patch at any point leading up to the deadline, please coordinate with us so that we may release our advisory detailing the issue. If the 120-day deadline is reached and no patch has been made available we will release a limited public advisory with our own mitigations, so that the public can protect themselves in the absence of a patch. Please keep us updated regarding the status of this issue and feel free to contact us at any time:\n\nZero Day Initiative\nzdi-disclosures@trendmicro.com\n\nThe PGP key used for all ZDI vendor communications is available from:\n\n  http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/documents/disclosures-pgp-key.asc\n\n-- INFORMATION ABOUT THE ZDI --------------------\nEstablished by TippingPoint and acquired by Trend Micro, the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) neither re-sells vulnerability details nor exploit code. Instead, upon notifying the affected product vendor, the ZDI provides its Trend Micro TippingPoint customers with zero day protection through its intrusion prevention technology. Explicit details regarding the specifics of the vulnerability are not exposed to any parties until an official vendor patch is publicly available.\n\nPlease contact us for further details or refer to:\n\n  http://www.zerodayinitiative.com\n\n-- DISCLOSURE POLICY ----------------------------\n\nOur vulnerability disclosure policy is available online at:\n\n  http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/disclosure_policy/",
