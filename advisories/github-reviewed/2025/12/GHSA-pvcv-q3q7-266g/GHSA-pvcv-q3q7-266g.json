  "summary": "Filament multi-factor authentication (app) recovery codes can be used multiple times",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nA flaw in the handling of recovery codes for **app-based multi-factor authentication** allows the same recovery code to be reused indefinitely. This issue does **not** affect email-based MFA. It also only applies when recovery codes are enabled.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf an attacker gains access to both the user's password and their recovery codes, they can repeatedly complete MFA without the user's app-based second factor. This weakens the expected security of MFA by turning recovery codes into a static, long-term bypass method.",
