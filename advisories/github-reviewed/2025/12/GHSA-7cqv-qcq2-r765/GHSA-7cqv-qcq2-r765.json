  "summary": "1Panel IP Access Control Bypass via Untrusted X-Forwarded-For Headers",
  "details": "### Summary\nThe server trusts all reverse-proxy headers by default, so any remote client can spoof `X-Forwarded-For` to bypass IP-based protections (AllowIPs, API IP whitelist, “localhost-only” checks). All IP-based access control becomes ineffective.\n\n### Details\n- Gin is created with defaults (`gin.Default()`), which sets `TrustedProxies = 0.0.0.0/0` and uses `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Real-IP` to compute `ClientIP()`.\n\n- IP-based controls rely on `ClientIP()`:\n    - AllowIPs / BindDomain (core/middleware/ip_limit.go, core/utils/security/security.go).\n    - API IP whitelist (core/middleware/api_auth.go).\n    - \"localhost-only\" checks that depend on `ClientIP()`.\n\n- Because no trusted-proxy range is enforced, any client can send `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` (or a whitelisted IP) and be treated as coming from that address.\n\n### Impact\nAll IP-based access control is rendered ineffective: remote clients can masquerade as localhost or any whitelisted IP, defeating AllowIPs, API IP whitelists, and “localhost-only” protections.",
