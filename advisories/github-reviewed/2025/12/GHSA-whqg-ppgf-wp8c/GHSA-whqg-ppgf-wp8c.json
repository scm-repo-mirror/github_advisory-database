  "details": "# Authentication Bypass via Double URL Encoding in Astro\n## Bypass for CVE-2025-64765 / GHSA-ggxq-hp9w-j794\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nA **double URL encoding bypass** allows any unauthenticated attacker to bypass path-based authentication checks in Astro middleware, granting unauthorized access to protected routes. While the original CVE-2025-64765 (single URL encoding) was fixed in v5.15.8, the fix is insufficient as it only decodes once. By using double-encoded URLs like `/%2561dmin` instead of `/%61dmin`, attackers can still bypass authentication and access protected resources such as `/admin`, `/api/internal`, or any route protected by middleware pathname checks.\n\n\n## Fix \n\nA more secure fix is just decoding once, then if the request has a %xx format, return a 400 error by using something like :\n\n```\nif (containsEncodedCharacters(pathname)) {\n            // Multi-level encoding detected - reject request\n            return new Response(\n                'Bad Request: Multi-level URL encoding is not allowed',\n                {\n                    status: 400,\n                    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }\n                }\n            );\n        }\n```",
