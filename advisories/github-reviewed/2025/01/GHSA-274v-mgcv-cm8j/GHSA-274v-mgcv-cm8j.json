  "summary": "Argo CD GitOps Engine does not scrub secret values from patch errors",
  "details": "### Impact\nA vulnerability was discovered in Argo CD that exposed secret values in error messages and the diff view when an invalid Kubernetes Secret resource was synced from a repository. \n\nThe vulnerability assumes the user has write access to the repository and can exploit it, either intentionally or unintentionally, by committing an invalid Secret to repository and triggering a Sync. Once exploited, any user with read access to Argo CD can view the exposed secret data.\n\n### Patches\nA patch for this vulnerability is available in the following Argo CD versions:\n- v2.13.4\n- v2.12.10\n- v2.11.13\n- v2.14 and later\n\nAffected branches:\n- release-0.7 (including tags v0.7.0, v0.7.2, v0.7.3)\n- argo-cd-release-2.8\n- argo-cd-release-2.9\n- argo-cd-release-2.10\n\nRemediated branches:\n- argo-cd-release-2.11\n- release-2.12\n- release-2.13\n- release-2.14\n- master\n\n### Workarounds\nUpgrade to commits from remediated branches with pseudo-version higher than v0.7.1-0.20250129155113 and less than v0.7.2.\n\nCurrently webform is preventing me to submit that `>= v0.7.2, <= v0.7.3` are still affected.\n\n### References\nFixed with commit\n- https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/commit/a4b7cc110bf16b01daf5b9c7e0e4f3654dfa62db\n- https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/commit/faf5a4e5c37d22fedaa2726b430af5b5ae9e567a\n- https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/commit/4c6e03c46314d861f05a92440c5f7dd516f85016\n- https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/commit/c19f8cfa4d27b0d1b027c9418409ebdbc28d3169\n- https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/commit/7e21b91e9d0f64104c8a661f3f390c5e6d73ddca",
