  "summary": "matrix-js-sdk has insufficient validation when considering a room to be upgraded by another",
  "details": "### Impact\nmatrix-js-sdk before 38.2.0 has insufficient validation of room predecessor links in `MatrixClient::getJoinedRooms`, allowing a remote attacker to attempt to replace a tombstoned room with an unrelated attacker-supplied room.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been patched and users should upgrade to 38.2.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nAvoid using `MatrixClient::getJoinedRooms` in favour of `getRooms()` and filtering upgraded rooms separately.",
