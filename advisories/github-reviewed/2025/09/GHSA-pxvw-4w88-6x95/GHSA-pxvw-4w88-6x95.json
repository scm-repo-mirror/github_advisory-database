  "details": "There was a missing permission-check in the shares feature (the `shr` global-option).\n\nWhen a share is created for just one file inside a folder, it was possible to access the other files inside that folder by guessing the filenames.\n\nIt was not possible to descend into subdirectories in this manner; only the sibling files were accessible.\n\nThis issue did not affect filekeys or dirkeys.",
