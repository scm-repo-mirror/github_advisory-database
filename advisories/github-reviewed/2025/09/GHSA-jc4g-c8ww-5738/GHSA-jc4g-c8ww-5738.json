  "details": "# Summary\nA reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists under certain conditions, using a specially crafter url to view a user profile\n\n# Description\nDNN’s URL/path handling and template rendering can allow specially crafted input to be reflected into a user profile that are returned to the browser. In these cases, the application does not sufficiently neutralize or encode characters that are meaningful in HTML, so an attacker can cause a victim’s browser to interpret attacker-controlled content as part of the page’s HTML.",
