  "summary": "Apache Shiro has an Authentication Bypass",
  "details": "### Impact\n\n**Authentication Bypass:**\nA vulnerability exists in Apache Shiro that allows authentication bypass for static files when served from a case-insensitive filesystem (such as the default configuration on macOS or Windows).\n\nThe issue arises when Shiro's URL filters are configured with lower-case rules (a common default), but the underlying operating system treats mixed-case filenames as identical. An attacker can access protected static resources by varying the capitalization of the filename in the request (e.g., requesting `/SECRET.TXT` to bypass a rule for `/secret.txt`).\n\nThis issue specifically affects static file handling and does not impact dynamic resource paths that are case-sensitive.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to Apache Shiro **2.1.0** or later.\n\n**Important Configuration Note:**\nVersion 2.1.0 introduces a new configuration parameter to handle case-insensitivity, which must be enabled manually to resolve the issue:\n\n* **shiro.ini:**\n    ```ini\n    filterChainResolver.caseInsensitive = true\n    ```\n* **Spring Boot (application.properties):**\n    ```properties\n    shiro.caseInsensitive=true\n    ```\n\n*Note: Apache Shiro 3.0.0 (upcoming) will enable this setting by default.*\n\n### Workarounds\n* Ensure that the filesystem hosting the application is case-sensitive (e.g., Linux/Unix).\n* Manually configure all Shiro filter chains to handle all possible case variations of protected filenames (not recommended due to complexity).\n\n### Resources\n* [CVE-2026-23903](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23903)\n* [Mailing List Announcement](https://lists.apache.org/thread/5jjf0hnjcol58z2m5y255c7scz1lnp8k)\n* [OSS-Security List](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/02/08/1)",
