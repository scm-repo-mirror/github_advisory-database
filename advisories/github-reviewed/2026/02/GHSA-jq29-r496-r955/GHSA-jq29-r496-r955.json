  "summary": "payload-preferences has Cross-Collection IDOR in Access Control (Multi-Auth Environments)",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nA cross-collection Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `payload-preferences` internal collection. In multi-auth collection environments using Postgres or SQLite with default serial/auto-increment IDs, authenticated users from one auth collection can read and delete preferences belonging to users in different auth collections when their numeric IDs collide.\n\n**Users are affected if ALL of these are true:**\n\n- Multiple auth collections configured (e.g., `admins` + `customers`)\n- Postgres or SQLite database adapter with serial/auto-increment IDs\n- Users in different auth collections with the same numeric ID\n\n**Not affected:**\n\n- `@payloadcms/db-mongodb` adapter\n- Single auth collection environments\n- Postgres/SQLite with `idType: 'uuid'`\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been patched in **v3.74.0**. Users should upgrade to v3.74.0 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround other than upgrading. Users with multiple auth collections using Postgres or SQLite with serial IDs should upgrade immediately.",
