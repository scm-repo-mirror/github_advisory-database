  "summary": "Claude Code has Permission Deny Bypass Through Symbolic Links",
  "details": "Claude Code failed to strictly enforce deny rules configured in settings.json when accessing files through symbolic links. If a user explicitly denied Claude Code access to a file (such as /etc/passwd) and Claude Code had access to a symbolic link pointing to that file, it was possible for Claude Code to read the restricted file through the symlink without triggering deny rule enforcement. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nClaude Code thanks https://hackerone.com/ofirh for reporting this issue.",
