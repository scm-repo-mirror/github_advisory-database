  "details": "### Summary\nPrevious rPGP versions could be caused to crash with a \"stack overflow\" when parsing messages that contain deeply nested message layers, such as messages with many signatures.\n\nrPGP 0.19.0 resolves this issue with a more robust message handling implementation (via https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp/pull/625).\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker could cause applications to crash in rPGP's message parsing subsystem, when applications attempt to ingest messages.\n\n### Attribution\nDiscovered internally during rPGP development, using a fuzz test suite previously contributed by Christian Reitter.",
