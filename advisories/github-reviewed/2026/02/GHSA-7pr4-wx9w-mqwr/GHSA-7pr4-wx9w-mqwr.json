  "summary": "Craft CMS Vulnerable to Stored XSS in Entry Types Name",
  "details": "## Summary\n\nStored XSS via Entry Type names. The name is not sanitized when displayed in the Entry Types list.\n\n---\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### Required Permissions (Attacker)\n\n- Admin access (only admins have access to the settings page)\n- `allowAdminChanges` is enabled in production, which is against our [security recommendations](https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/securing-craft).\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Log in as an attacker.\n2. Go to **Settings** -> **Entry Types** (`/admin/settings/entry-types`).\n3. Create a new Entry Type.\n4. Set **Name** to:\n```html\n<img src=x onerror=\"alert('XSS-EntryTypes')\" hidden>\n```\n5. Save the Entry Type, and you’ll be redirected back to the entry types table automatically.\n6. Notice the alert fires when the entry types table renders.",
