  "summary": "jsPDF Vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via Unvalidated BMP Dimensions in BMPDecoder",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nUser control of the first argument of the `addImage` method results in Denial of Service.\n\nIf given the possibility to pass unsanitized image data or URLs to the `addImage` method, a user can provide a harmful BMP file that results in out of memory errors and denial of service. Harmful BMP files have large width and/or height entries in their headers, wich lead to excessive memory allocation.\n\nOther affected methods are: `html`.\n\nExample attack vector:\n\n```js\nimport { jsPDF } from \"jspdf\" \n\n// malicious BMP image data with large width/height headers\nconst payload = ...\n\nconst doc = new jsPDF();\n\ndoc.addImage(payload, \"BMP\", 0, 0, 100, 100);\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in jsPDF 4.1.0. Upgrade to jspdf@>=4.1.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSanitize image data or URLs before passing it to the addImage method or one of the other affected methods.",
