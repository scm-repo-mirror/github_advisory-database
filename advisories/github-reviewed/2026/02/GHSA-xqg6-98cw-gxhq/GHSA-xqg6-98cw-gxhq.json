  "summary": "Prototype Pollution via FormData Processing in Qwik City",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nA Prototype Pollution vulnerability exists in the `formToObj()` function within `@builder.io/qwik-city` middleware. The function processes form field names with dot notation (e.g., `user.name`) to create nested objects, but fails to sanitize dangerous property names like `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`. This allows unauthenticated attackers to pollute `Object.prototype` by sending crafted HTTP POST requests, potentially leading to privilege escalation, authentication bypass, or denial of service.\n\n### Impact\nAn unauthenticated attacker can supply specially crafted form field names that cause formToObj() to write dangerous keys (for example __proto__, constructor, prototype) into parsed objects. This results in Prototype Pollution of the server process and can cause privilege escalation, auth bypass, denial-of-service, or other global application integrity failures depending on how objects are used.",
