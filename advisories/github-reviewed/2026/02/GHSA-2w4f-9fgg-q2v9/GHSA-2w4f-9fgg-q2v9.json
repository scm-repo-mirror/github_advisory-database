  "summary": "melange has a path traversal in license-path which allows reading files outside workspace ",
  "details": "An attacker who can influence a melange configuration file (e.g., through pull request-driven CI or build-as-a-service scenarios) could read arbitrary files from the host system. The `LicensingInfos` function in `pkg/config/config.go` reads license files specified in `copyright[].license-path` without validating that paths remain within the workspace directory, allowing path traversal via `../` sequences. The contents of the traversed file are embedded into the generated SBOM as license text, enabling exfiltration of sensitive data through build artifacts.                                                                                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n  Fix: Merged in commit 2f95c9f4\n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n  Acknowledgements                                                                                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nmelange thanks Oleh Konko (@1seal) from 1seal for discovering and reporting this issue.",
