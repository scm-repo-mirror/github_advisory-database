  "summary": "Apache Airflow UI Exposes DAG Import Errors to Unauthorized Authenticated Users",
  "details": "### Impact\n\n**Exposure of Sensitive Information:**\n\nAn information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Apache Airflow UI that allows authenticated users to view `Import Errors` for DAGs they are not authorized to access.\n\nIn affected versions, the **Import Errors** view does not correctly filter errors based on granular DAG permissions. This means a user with access to only `DAG_A` can view import errors generated by `DAG_B`, `DAG_C`, or system-level DAGs. These error logs often contain file paths, code snippets, or stack traces that reveal the internal structure and logic of restricted DAGs.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to Apache Airflow **3.1.7** or later.\nThis version strictly enforces DAG-level permissions on the Import Errors view.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds other than upgrading.\n\n### Resources\n\n* [CVE-2026-24098](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24098)\n* [Pull Request #60801](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/60801)\n* [Mailing List Announcement](https://lists.apache.org/thread/nx96435v77xdst7ls5lk57kqvqyj095x)",
