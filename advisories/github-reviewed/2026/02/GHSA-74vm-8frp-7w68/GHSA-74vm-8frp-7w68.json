  "summary": "EPyT-Flow vulnerable to unsafe JSON deserialization (__type__)",
  "details": "### Impact\nEPyT-Flow’s REST API parses attacker-controlled JSON request bodies using a custom deserializer (my_load_from_json) that supports a __type__ field. When __type__ is present, the deserializer dynamically imports an attacker-specified module/class and instantiates it with attacker-supplied arguments. This allows invoking dangerous classes such as subprocess.Popen, which can lead to OS command execution during JSON parsing. This also affects the loading of JSON files.\n\n### Patches\nEPyT-Flow  has been patched in 0.16.1 -- affects all versions <= 0.16.0\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not load any JSON from untrusted sources and do not expose the REST API.\n\n### Credits\nEPyT-Flow  thanks Jarrett Chan (@syphonetic) for detecting and reporting the bug.",
