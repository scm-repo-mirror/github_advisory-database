  "summary": "Craft CMS has Stored XSS in Tax Rates Name Leading to Potential Privilege Escalation",
  "details": "## Summary\nA stored XSS vulnerability in Craft Commerce allows attackers to execute malicious JavaScript in an administrator's browser. This occurs because the Tax Rates 'Name' field in the **Store Management** section is not properly sanitized before being displayed in the admin panel.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### Requirments\n- General permissions:\n\t- Access the control panel\n\t- Access Craft Commerce\n- Craft Commerce permissions:\n\t- Manage store settings\n\t- Manage taxes\n- An active administrator elevated session\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Log in to the Admin Panel with the attacker account with the permissions mentioned above.\n2. Navigate to **Commerce** -> **Store Management** -> **Tax Rates** (`/admin/commerce/store-management/primary/taxrates`).\n3. Create a new tax rate.\n4. In the **Name** field, enter the following payload:\n```html\n<img src=x onerror=\"alert(document.domain)\">\n```\n4. Pick or create a Tax Category since it’s required to save the tax rate.\n5. Click **Save** and you’ll be redirected back to the previous page.\n6. Notice the alert proving JavaScript execution.\n<img width=\"1887\" height=\"709\" alt=\"poc-alert\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbcebb85-dbc7-467c-aca1-7446a67918f2\" />\n\n\n\n### Privilege Escalation to Administrator:\n1. Do the same steps above, but replace the payload with a malicious one.\n2. The following payload elevates the attacker’s account to Admin if there’s already an elevated session, replace the `<UserID>` with your attacker id:\n\n```html\n<img src=x onerror=\"fetch('/admin/users/<UserID>/permissions',{method:'POST',body:`CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN=${Craft.csrfTokenValue}&userId=<UserID>&admin=1&action=users/save-permissions`,headers:{'content-type':'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}})\">\n```\n4. In another browser, log in as an admin & go to the vulnerable page (tax rates page).\n5. Go back to your attacker account & notice you are now an admin.\n\nThe privilege escalation requires an elevated session. In a real-world scenario, an attacker can automate the process by forcing a logout if the victim’s session is stale; upon re-authentication, the stored XSS payload executes within a fresh elevated session to complete the attack.\n\nOr even easier (and smarter), an attacker (using the XSS) can create a fake 'Session Expired' login modal overlay. Since it's on the trusted domain, administrators will likely enter their credentials, sending them directly to the attacker.\n\n### Resources:\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/commerce/commit/fa273330807807d05b564d37c88654cd772839ee",
