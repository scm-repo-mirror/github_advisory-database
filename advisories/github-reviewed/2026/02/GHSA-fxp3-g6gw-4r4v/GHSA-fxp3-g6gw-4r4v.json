  "summary": "Craft CMS: GraphQL Asset Mutation Privilege Escalation",
  "details": "There is a Privilege Escalation vulnerability in Craft CMS’s GraphQL API that allows an authenticated user with write access to one asset volume to escalate their privileges and modify/transfer assets belonging to any other volume, including restricted or private volumes to which they should not have access.\n\n## Summary:\n\nType: Privilege Escalation (CWE-269)\nAffected: Craft CMS 5.x (likely affects 4.x and 3.x as well)\nLocation: `src/gql/resolvers/mutations/Asset.php lines 57-107`\n\n## Root Cause:\n\nThe saveAsset GraphQL mutation validates authorization against the schema-resolved volume but fetches the target asset by ID without verifying that the asset belongs to the authorized volume. This allows unauthorized cross-volume asset modification and transfer.\n\n## Impact:\n\n- Transfer confidential assets from private volumes to public volumes (data exfiltration)\n- Modify asset metadata in restricted volumes\n- Bypass multi-tenant isolation in shared hosting environments",
