  "summary": "FroshAdminer Adminer UI is accessible without admin session",
  "details": "### Summary\nUnauthenticated access to Adminer UI\n\n### Details\nThe Adminer route (/admin/adminer) was accessible without Shopware admin authentication. The route was configured with auth_required=false and performed no session validation, exposing the Adminer UI to unauthenticated users.\n\nNote: Database access itself requires credentials that are only set through the ACL-protected API endpoint. Direct database access without prior admin login is not possible through this vulnerability alone.\n\n### Impact\nAn unauthenticated user could access the Adminer interface, potentially disclosing version information or exploiting Adminer-specific vulnerabilities.\n\n### Patches\nVersion 2.2.1 adds session validation. The Adminer route now verifies an authenticated session flag before rendering — returning HTTP 403 otherwise.\n\n### Workarounds\nDeactivate or uninstall the plugin.",
