  ],
  "summary": "cert-manager-controller DoS via Specially Crafted DNS Response",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe cert-manager-controller performs DNS lookups during ACME DNS-01 processing (for zone discovery and propagation self-checks). By default, these lookups use standard unencrypted DNS.\n\nAn attacker who can intercept and modify DNS traffic from the cert-manager-controller pod can insert a crafted entry into cert-manager's DNS cache. Accessing this entry will trigger a panic, resulting in Denial of Service (DoS) of the cert-manager controller.\n\nThe issue can also be exploited if the authoritative DNS server for the domain being validated is controlled by a malicious actor.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability was introduced in cert-manager v1.18.0 and has been patched in cert-manager v1.19.3 and v1.18.5, which are the supported minor releases at the time of publishing.\n\ncert-manager versions prior to v1.18.0 are unaffected.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- Using DNS-over-HTTPS reduces the risk of DNS traffic being intercepted and modified.\n    - Note that DNS-over-HTTPS does *not* prevent the risk of an attacker-controlled authoritative DNS server.\n\n### Resources\n\n- Fix for cert-manager 1.18: https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/8467\n- Fix for cert-manager 1.19: https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/8468\n- Fix for master branch: https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/8469\n\n### Credits\n\nHuge thanks to Oleh Konko (@1seal) for reporting the issue, providing a detailed PoC and an initial patch!",
