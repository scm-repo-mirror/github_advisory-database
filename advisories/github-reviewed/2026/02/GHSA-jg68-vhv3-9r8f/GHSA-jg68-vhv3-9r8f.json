  "summary": "Magento's X-Original-Url header can expose admin url",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe admin url can be discovered without prior knowledge of its location by exploiting the X-Original-Url header on some configurations.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe bug comes from the Zend library.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUnset the X-Original-Url header in the web server configuration.\n\n### Resources\n\nhttps://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=openmage&report_id=3416312\n\nUpon deeper investigation, it was initially not found, but then it was realized that the search excluded the vendor/ directory. This is coming from the Zend_Controller module. Here is another tip from 2016 - it is surprising that this was not somehow patched already!\n\nhttps://peterocallaghan.co.uk/2016/12/magento-poisoning-cache/ (dead link now..)\n\n### Credit\n\nAnees Hyder (anees0x_dev) on HackerOne\nhttps://hackerone.com/anees0x_dev/hacktivity?type=user",
