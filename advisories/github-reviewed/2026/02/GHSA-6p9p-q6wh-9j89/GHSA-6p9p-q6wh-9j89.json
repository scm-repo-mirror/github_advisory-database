  "summary": "apko affected by unbounded resource consumption in expandapk.Split on attacker-controlled .apk streams ",
  "details": "`expandapk.Split` drains the first gzip stream of an APK archive via `io.Copy(io.Discard, gzi)` without explicit bounds. With an attacker-controlled input stream, this can force large gzip inflation work and lead to resource exhaustion (availability impact).                                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                                                                                                              \nThe `Split` function reads the first tar header, then drains the remainder of the gzip stream by reading from the gzip reader directly without any maximum uncompressed byte limit or inflate-ratio cap. A caller that parses attacker-controlled APK streams may be forced to spend excessive CPU time inflating gzip data, leading to timeouts or process slowdown.             \n                                                                                                                                                                                              \n**Fix:** Fixed with [2be3903](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/commit/2be3903fe194ad46351840f0569b35f5ac965f09), Released in v1.1.0.                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                                              \n**Acknowledgements**                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                                                                                                             \napko thanks Oleh Konko from [1seal](https://1seal.org/) for discovering and reporting this issue.",
