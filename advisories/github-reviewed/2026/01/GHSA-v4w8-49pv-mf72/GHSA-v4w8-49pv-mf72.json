  "summary": "ChatterBot Vulnerable to Denial of Service via Database Connection Pool Exhaustion",
  "details": "### Summary\nChatterBot versions up to 1.2.10 are vulnerable to a denial-of-service condition caused by improper database session and connection pool management. Concurrent invocations of the get_response() method can exhaust the underlying SQLAlchemy connection pool, resulting in persistent service unavailability and requiring a manual restart to recover.\n\n### Details\nChatterBot relies on SQLAlchemy for database access and uses a connection pool with default limits. The get_response() method does not enforce concurrency limits, rate limiting, or explicit session lifecycle controls.\n\nWhen multiple threads concurrently invoke get_response(), database connections are rapidly consumed and not released in a timely manner. This leads to exhaustion of the SQLAlchemy QueuePool, causing subsequent requests to block and eventually fail with a TimeoutError.\n\nThis issue can be triggered without authentication in deployments where ChatterBot is exposed as a chatbot service, making it exploitable by remote attackers to cause denial of service.\n\nPoC Video: \nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ee845c4-b847-4854-84ec-4b2fb2f7090f\n\n### PoC\n1. Install ChatterBot version 1.2.10.\n2. Use the default database configuration (SQLite / SQLAlchemy).\n3. Run the following Python script to invoke concurrent requests:\n\nfrom chatterbot import ChatBot\nimport threading\n\nbot = ChatBot(\"dos-test\")\n\ndef attack():\n    bot.get_response(\"hello\")\n\nthreads = []\nfor _ in range(30):\n    t = threading.Thread(target=attack)\n    t.start()\n    threads.append(t)\n\nfor t in threads:\n    t.join()\n\n4. Observe that the application becomes unresponsive and raises SQLAlchemy TimeoutError exceptions indicating exhaustion of the connection pool.\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a denial-of-service condition by exhausting the database connection pool. Once triggered, the chatbot becomes unresponsive to legitimate users and requires a manual restart to restore functionality.\n\nAll deployments of ChatterBot version 1.2.10 or earlier that allow concurrent access to the get_response() method are impacted.",
