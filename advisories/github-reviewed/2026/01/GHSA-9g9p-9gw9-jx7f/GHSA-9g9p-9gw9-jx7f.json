  "summary": "Next.js self-hosted applications vulnerable to DoS via Image Optimizer remotePatterns configuration",
  "details": "A DoS vulnerability exists in self-hosted Next.js applications that have `remotePatterns` configured for the Image Optimizer. The image optimization endpoint (`/_next/image`) loads external images entirely into memory without enforcing a maximum size limit, allowing an attacker to cause out-of-memory conditions by requesting optimization of arbitrarily large images. This vulnerability requires that `remotePatterns` is configured to allow image optimization from external domains and that the attacker can serve or control a large image on an allowed domain.\n\nStrongly consider upgrading to 15.5.10 and 16.1.5 to reduce risk and prevent availability issues in Next applications.",
