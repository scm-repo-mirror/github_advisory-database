  "summary": "Umbraco.Forms has Path Traversal and File Enumeration Vulnerabilities in Linux/Mac",
  "details": "### Impact\nIt's possible for an authenticated backoffice-user to enumerate and traverse paths/files on the systems filesystem and read their contents, on Mac/Linux Umbraco installations using Forms. As Umbraco Cloud runs in a Windows environment, Cloud users aren't affected. \n\n### Patches\nThis issue affects versions 16 and 17 of Umbraco Forms and is patched in 16.4.1 and 17.1.1\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, users can mitigate this vulnerability by:\n* Configuring a WAF or reverse proxy to block requests containing path traversal sequences (`../`, `..\\`) in the `fileName` parameter of the export endpoint\n* Restricting network access to the Umbraco backoffice to trusted IP ranges\n* Blocking the `/umbraco/forms/api/v1/export` endpoint entirely if the export feature is not required\n\nHowever, upgrading to the patched version is strongly recommended.\n\n### References\nCredit to Kevin Joensen from Baldur Security for finding this vulnerability",
