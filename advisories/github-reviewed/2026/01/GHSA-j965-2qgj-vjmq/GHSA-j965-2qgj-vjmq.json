  "summary": "JavaScript SDK v2 users should add validation to the region parameter value in or migrate to v3",
  "details": "CVSSv3.1 Rating: 3.7 (LOW)\n\nSummary\nThis notification is related to the use of specific values for the region input field when calling AWS services. An actor with access to the environment in which the SDK is used could set the region input field to an invalid value. Per the AWS shared responsibility model, customer applications should protect instances appropriately, or implement proper input sanitization checks. The AWS SDK for JavaScript v2 reached end-of-support on September 8, 2025, but a defense-in-depth enhancement has been implemented in AWS SDK for JavaScript v3. Please migrate to that version.\n\nImpact\nCustomer applications could be configured to improperly route AWS API calls to non-existent or non-AWS hosts. While the SDK itself is functioning as designed, we recommend customers migrate to AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 for continued support and enhanced security features.\n\nImpacted versions: All versions of AWS SDK for JavaScript v2\n\nPatches\nNo security patch is required, this is an informational advisory.\n\nWorkarounds\n- Implement proper input sanitization in your application code\n- Migrate to AWS SDK for JavaScript v3\n- Follow AWS security best practices for SDK configuration\n\nReferences\nContact AWS Security via the vulnerability reporting page or email [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).\n\nAcknowledgement\nAWS Security thanks Guy Arazi for bringing these customer security considerations to our attention through the coordinated disclosure process.",
