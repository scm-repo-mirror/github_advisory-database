  "summary": "Python-Multipart has Arbitrary File Write via Non-Default Configuration",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nA Path Traversal vulnerability exists when using non-default configuration options `UPLOAD_DIR` and `UPLOAD_KEEP_FILENAME=True`. An attacker can write uploaded files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem by crafting a malicious filename.\n\n### Details\n\nWhen `UPLOAD_DIR` is set and `UPLOAD_KEEP_FILENAME` is `True`, the library constructs the file path using `os.path.join(file_dir, fname)`. Due to the behavior of `os.path.join()`, if the filename begins with a `/`, all preceding path components are discarded:\n\n```py\nos.path.join(\"/upload/dir\", \"/etc/malicious\") == \"/etc/malicious\"\n```\n                        \nThis allows an attacker to bypass the intended upload directory and write files to arbitrary paths.                                         \n                                                                                                                                              \n#### Affected Configuration                                                                                                                      \n                                                                                                                                              \nProjects are only affected if all of the following are true:                                                                                     \n- `UPLOAD_DIR` is set\n- `UPLOAD_KEEP_FILENAME` is set to True\n- The uploaded file exceeds `MAX_MEMORY_FILE_SIZE` (triggering a flush to disk)\n\nThe default configuration is not vulnerable.                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                              \n#### Impact                                                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                                                              \nArbitrary file write to attacker-controlled paths on the filesystem.                                                                        \n                                                                                                                                              \n#### Mitigation                                                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                              \nUpgrade to version 0.0.22, or avoid using `UPLOAD_KEEP_FILENAME=True` in project configurations.",
