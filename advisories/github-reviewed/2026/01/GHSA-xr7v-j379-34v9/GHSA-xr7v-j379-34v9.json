  "summary": "NocoDB has Blind SSRF via Unvalidated HEAD Request in uploadViaURL Functionality",
  "details": "## Summary\n\nA **blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** vulnerability exists in the `uploadViaURL` functionality due to an unprotected `HEAD` request. While the subsequent file retrieval logic correctly enforces SSRF protections, the initial metadata request executes without validation.\n\nThis allows limited outbound requests to arbitrary URLs before SSRF controls are applied.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\nThe `uploadViaURL()` function issues an `axios.head()` request to retrieve metadata (content type, content length, and final URL after redirects). This request is performed **without SSRF filtering**.\n\nAlthough the actual file download is protected by request filtering, the initial `HEAD` request occurs prior to these checks and can be triggered with an attacker-controlled URL.\n\n### Vulnerable Code\n\n```ts\nif (!url.startsWith('data:')) {\n  response = await axios.head(url, { maxRedirects: 5 });\n  mimeType = response.headers['content-type']?.split(';')[0];\n  size = response.headers['content-length'];\n  finalUrl = response.request.res.responseUrl;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\nThe impact of this issue is **limited** due to the following constraints:\n\n* Only `HEAD` requests are affected (no response body is returned)\n* No direct exfiltration of response data occurs\n* The subsequent file-fetching logic enforces SSRF protections\n\nHowever, the vulnerability may still allow:\n\n* **Blind SSRF** via outbound `HEAD` requests\n* **Limited internal service probing** (reachability and response behavior)\n* **Interaction with sensitive internal endpoints** that respond to `HEAD` requests\n\nThis issue does **not** provide arbitrary data access or full internal network compromise on its own.\n\n---\n\n## Severity\n\n**Moderate**\n\nThe vulnerability is limited in scope and impact:\n\n* Only `HEAD` requests are affected\n* No response body or sensitive data is directly returned\n* The actual file download logic enforces SSRF protections\n\nWhile the issue permits blind outbound requests to attacker-controlled URLs, it does not enable direct data exfiltration or full internal network compromise on its own.\n\n---\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/v2/storage/upload-by-url' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -H 'xc-auth: <token>' \\\n  -d '[{\n    \"url\": \"http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/\",\n    \"fileName\": \"test.txt\"\n  }]'\n```\n\nThis request causes the server to issue an unfiltered `HEAD` request before SSRF protections are applied.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis issue was first identified and responsibly disclosed by Faizan Raza of Kolega.dev as part of a security assessment using Kolega.dev Deep Code Scan, including validation and fix recommendations.\n\nNocoDB also acknowledges Neel B for independently reporting the same issue prior to publication.\n\nNocoDB thanks Kolega.dev for their contribution to improving the security posture of the project.",
