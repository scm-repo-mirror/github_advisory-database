  "summary": "n8n: Webhook Node IP Whitelist Bypass via Partial String Matching",
  "details": "## Impact\nThe Webhook node’s IP whitelist validation performed partial string matching instead of exact IP comparison. As a result, an incoming request could be accepted if the source IP address merely contained the configured whitelist entry as a substring.\n\nThis issue affected instances where workflow editors relied on IP-based access controls to restrict webhook access. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were impacted. An attacker with a non-whitelisted IP could bypass restrictions if their IP shared a partial prefix with a trusted address, undermining the intended security boundary.\n\n## Patches\nThis issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to v2.2.0 or later, where IP whitelist validation uses strict IP comparison logic rather than partial string matching.\n\n## Workarounds\nUsers unable to upgrade immediately should avoid relying solely on IP whitelisting for webhook security. Recommended mitigations include:\n- Adding authentication mechanisms such as shared secrets, HMAC signatures, or API keys.\n- Avoiding short or prefix-based whitelist entries.\n- Enforcing IP filtering at the network layer (for example, via reverse proxies or firewalls).",
