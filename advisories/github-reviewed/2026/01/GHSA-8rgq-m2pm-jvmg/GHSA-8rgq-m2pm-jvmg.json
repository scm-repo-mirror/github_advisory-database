  "summary": "Duplicate Advisory: gix-date can create non-utf8 string with `TimeBuf::as_str`",
  "details": "### Duplicate Advisory\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-6mw6-mj76-grwc. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nA flaw was found in gix-date. The `gix_date::parse::TimeBuf::as_str` function can generate strings containing invalid non-UTF8 characters. This issue violates the internal safety invariants of the `TimeBuf` component, leading to undefined behavior when these malformed strings are subsequently processed. This could potentially result in application instability or other unforeseen consequences.",
