  "summary": "October CMS Vulnerable to Stored XSS via Editor and Branding Styles",
  "details": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities was identified in October CMS backend configuration forms:\n\n- **Editor Settings Markup Styles**  \n   A user with the `Global Editor Settings` permission could inject malicious HTML/JS into the stylesheet input at  \n   *Settings → Editor Settings → Markup Styles*.  \n\nA specially crafted input could break out of the intended `<style>` context, allowing arbitrary script execution across backend pages for all users.\n\n---\n\n### Impact\n- Persistent XSS across the backend interface.  \n- Exploitable by lower-privileged accounts with the above permissions.  \n- Potential consequences include privilege escalation, session hijacking, and execution of unauthorized actions in victim sessions.\n\n---\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in **v4.0.12** and **v3.7.13**.  \nStylesheet inputs are now sanitized to prevent injection of arbitrary HTML/JS.  \n\nAll users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched version.\n\n---\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading immediately is not possible:  \n- Restrict the permissions `Global Editor Settings` to fully trusted administrators only.  \n\nThis reduces exposure but does not fully eliminate risk.\n\n---\n\n### Credits\n- Reported by **[Nakkouch Tarek](https://github.com/nakkouchtarek)**",
