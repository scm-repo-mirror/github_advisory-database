  "details": "## Vulnerability Summary\n\n**Title:** Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Symlink Vulnerability in SoftFileLock\n\n**Affected Component:** `filelock` package - `SoftFileLock` class\n**File:** `src/filelock/_soft.py` lines 17-27\n**CWE:** CWE-362, CWE-367, CWE-59\n\n---\n\n## Description\n\nA TOCTOU race condition vulnerability exists in the `SoftFileLock` implementation of the filelock package. An attacker with local filesystem access and permission to create symlinks can exploit a race condition between the permission validation and file creation to cause lock operations to fail or behave unexpectedly.\n\nThe vulnerability occurs in the `_acquire()` method between `raise_on_not_writable_file()` (permission check) and `os.open()` (file creation). During this race window, an attacker can create a symlink at the lock file path, potentially causing the lock to operate on an unintended target file or leading to denial of service.\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\n```\n1. Lock attempts to acquire on /tmp/app.lock\n2. Permission validation passes\n3. [RACE WINDOW] - Attacker creates: ln -s /tmp/important.txt /tmp/app.lock\n4. os.open() tries to create lock file\n5. Lock operates on attacker-controlled target file or fails\n```\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis is a **Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability** affecting any application using `SoftFileLock` for inter-process synchronization.\n\n**Affected Users:**\n- Applications using `filelock.SoftFileLock` directly\n- Applications using the fallback `FileLock` on systems without `fcntl` support (e.g., GraalPy)\n\n**Consequences:**\n- **Silent lock acquisition failure** - applications may not detect that exclusive resource access is not guaranteed\n- **Denial of Service** - attacker can prevent lock file creation by maintaining symlink\n- **Resource serialization failures** - multiple processes may acquire \"locks\" simultaneously\n- **Unintended file operations** - lock could operate on attacker-controlled files\n\n**CVSS v4.0 Score:** 5.6 (Medium)\n**Vector:** CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AT:L/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N\n\n**Attack Requirements:**\n- Local filesystem access to the directory containing lock files\n- Permission to create symlinks (standard for regular unprivileged users on Unix/Linux)\n- Ability to time the symlink creation during the narrow race window\n\n---\n\n## Patches\n\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nYes, the vulnerability has been patched by adding the `O_NOFOLLOW` flag to prevent symlink following during lock file creation.\n\n**Patched Version:** Next release (commit: 255ed068bc85d1ef406e50a135e1459170dd1bf0)\n\n**Mitigation Details:**\n- The `O_NOFOLLOW` flag is added conditionally and gracefully degrades on platforms without support\n- On platforms with `O_NOFOLLOW` support (most modern systems): symlink attacks are completely prevented\n- On platforms without `O_NOFOLLOW` (e.g., GraalPy): TOCTOU window remains but is documented\n\n**Users should:**\n- Upgrade to the patched version when available\n- For critical deployments, consider using `UnixFileLock` or `WindowsFileLock` instead of the fallback `SoftFileLock`\n\n---\n\n## Workarounds\n\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nFor users unable to update immediately:\n\n1. **Avoid `SoftFileLock` in security-sensitive contexts** - use `UnixFileLock` or `WindowsFileLock` when available (these were already patched for CVE-2025-68146)\n\n2. **Restrict filesystem permissions** - prevent untrusted users from creating symlinks in lock file directories:\n   ```bash\n   chmod 700 /path/to/lock/directory\n   ```\n\n3. **Use process isolation** - isolate untrusted code from lock file paths to prevent symlink creation\n\n4. **Monitor lock operations** - implement application-level checks to verify lock acquisitions are successful before proceeding with critical operations\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n- **Similar Vulnerability:** CVE-2025-68146 (TOCTOU vulnerability in UnixFileLock/WindowsFileLock)\n- **CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource):** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/362.html\n- **CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use Race Condition):** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/367.html\n- **CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access):** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/59.html\n- **O_NOFOLLOW documentation:** https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html\n- **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/tox-dev/filelock\n\n---\n\n**Reported by:** George Tsigourakos (@tsigouris007)",
