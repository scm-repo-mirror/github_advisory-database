  "summary": "ComfyUI-Manager is Vulnerable to CRLF Injection in Configuration Handler",
  "details": "## Impact\n\n**Vulnerability Type**: CRLF Injection via ConfigParser\n\nAn attacker can inject special characters into HTTP query parameters to add arbitrary configuration values to the `config.ini` file. This can lead to security setting tampering or modification of application behavior.\n\n**Affected Users**: Users running ComfyUI-Manager in environments where ComfyUI is configured with the `--listen` option to allow remote access.\n\n**CVSS Score**: 7.5 (High)\n\n## Patches\n\nFixed in the following versions:\n- **3.39.2** (v3.x branch)\n- **4.0.5** (v4.x branch)\n\nSanitization logic was added to the `write_config()` function to remove CRLF and NULL characters from all string values.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not possible:\n- Run ComfyUI-Manager only on trusted networks\n- Block external access via firewall\n- Run on localhost only without the `--listen` option\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/93.html)\n- [OWASP CRLF Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/CRLF_Injection)\n\n## Credit\n\nThis vulnerability was reported by:\n- 李存义 <xiaoheihei1107@gmail.com>\n- D0n9 Li <wyd0n9@gmail.com>\n- Swings <swing@mail.exp.sh>\n- Osword from SGLAB of Legendsec at Qi'anxin Group <zhzhdoai@gmail.com>",
