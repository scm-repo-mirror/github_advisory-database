  ],
  "summary": "Denial of service in CBOR library",
  "details": "### Impact\nDue to this library's use of an inefficient algorithm, it is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when a maliciously crafted input is passed to `DecodeFromBytes` or other CBOR decoding mechanisms in this library.  \n\nAffected versions _include_ versions 4.0.0 through 4.5.0.\n\nThis vulnerability was privately reported to me.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been fixed in version 4.5.1.  Users should use the latest version of this library.  (The latest version is not necessarily 4.5.1.  Check the README for [this library's repository](https://github.com/peteroupc/CBOR-Java) to see the latest version's version number.)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAgain, users should use the latest version of this library.\n\nIn the meantime, note that the inputs affected by this issue are all CBOR maps or contain CBOR maps.  An input that decodes to a single CBOR object is not capable of containing a CBOR map if&mdash;\n\n- it begins with a byte other than 0x80 through 0xDF, or\n- it does not contain a byte in the range 0xa0 through 0xBF.\n\nSuch an input is not affected by this vulnerability and an application can choose to perform this check before passing it to a CBOR decoding mechanism.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the CBOR repository](https://github.com/peteroupc/CBOR-Java).",
