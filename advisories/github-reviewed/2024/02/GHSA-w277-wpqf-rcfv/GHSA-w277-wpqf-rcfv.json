  "details": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-747x-5m58-mq97. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nThe `Webhook::verify` function incorrectly compared signatures of different lengths - the two signatures would only be compared up to the length of the shorter signature. This allowed an attacker to pass in `v1,` as the signature, which would always pass verification.",
